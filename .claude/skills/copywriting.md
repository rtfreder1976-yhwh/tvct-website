# Elevated Direct Response Copywriting

Write copy that converts using this framework. Apply these principles to any copy request.

## Structure

### HEADLINE
- Lead with a **contrarian hook** (challenge assumptions, flip conventional wisdom)
- Include a **specific promise** (concrete outcome, not vague benefits)

### SUBHEAD
- Add **specifics** (numbers, timeframes, methods)
- Include **proof** (results, credentials, experience)
- Add a **friction reducer** (ease objections before they form)

### BODY
- Use **short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences max)
- Write in an **operator voice** (someone who's done the work, not theorized about it)
- Break up text with line breaks for scannability

### PROOF
Hierarchy of credibility (use in this order):
1. **Numbers** (metrics, results, data)
2. **Testimonials** (real words from real people)
3. **Claims** (only when backed by the above)

### CTA
Formula: **Action verb + what they get + →**
- Examples: "Get the checklist →" / "Book your free estimate →" / "Start your trial →"

## Tone

**Be a smart friend who built it themselves.**

You're not a corporation. You're not a guru. You're someone who figured something out and is sharing it plainly.

## Rules

### ALWAYS
- **Specificity** — Vague is forgettable. "Save 3 hours/week" beats "save time"
- **Systems thinking** — Show the how, not just the what
- **Proof** — Every claim needs backup

### NEVER
- **Inflated claims** — If it sounds too good, it probably reads as fake
- **Fake scarcity** — "Only 3 spots left!" when there aren't
- **Fluff** — Every word must earn its place

### AVOID
- **Corporate jargon** — "Leverage synergies" means nothing
- **Guru hype** — "10X your life" energy repels smart buyers
- **Vague promises** — "Transform your business" says nothing
