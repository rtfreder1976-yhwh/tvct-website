    Design the "Hands-Off" Agentic Infrastructure.
    
    Current Tech Stack:
    - Website: Astro (Static/SSR)
    - Booking Engine: Booking Koala (Standard Form)
    - Chat: GoHighLevel (GHL) Widget
    
    Pricing Logic (Crucial):
    - Flat Rate Tables exist for < 6000 sq ft (Standard, Deep, Move In/Out).
    - Recurring Logic: Deep Clean FIRST -> Cleaner sets hours/pay -> Price = (Cleaner Pay * 2).
    
    Map out exactly how AI agents will handle:
    1. **Pre-Booking**: Intercepting traffic on 200+ location pages to give an *Instant* SMS/Email quote using the JSON pricing model (bypassing the generic Booking Koala form initially to capture lead data).
    2. **Recurring Transition**: Automating the "Cleaner Feedback -> Price Calculation -> Client Proposal" loop.
    
    Identify necessary tools (n8n Webhooks, GHL API) to bridge Astro -> Pricing Engine -> GHL.
