**Target Areas**: Huntsville, Madison, Athens, Decatur, Florence (Shoals), West Nashville

## 1. The "Unfair Advantage" Strategy
*Why you will crush the competition.*

Most competitors have a single "Huntsville Cleaning" page. You have **200+ hyper-local pages** (e.g., `/locations/huntsville/jones-valley`, `/locations/nashville/belle-meade`). This is your digital real estate, but it's currently "passive". We will turn it "active".

### The Strategy: "Hyper-Local Trust & Speed"
**The Concept**: When a lead lands on the "Jones Valley" page, they shouldn't just see a generic cleaning offer. They should see:
1.  "We clean 14 homes in Jones Valley."
2.  "Your neighbor Sarah just gave us 5 stars."
3.  **"Get your Jones Valley Price in 30 seconds."**

**Competitor Weakness**: "Rosie Cleans" has instant booking, but they lack your SEO depth. They win on *convenience*, you win on *presence*. **We will steal their convenience.**

## 2. The Automation Architecture ("Zero-Touch" Operations)
*Goal: Lead -> Quote -> Booking -> Review without you lifting a finger.*

We will build an **Inter-App Agentic Workflow** using your existing Astro site + n8n + GoHighLevel (GHL).

### The Technology Stack
1.  **Frontend**: Your Astro Website (for speed & SEO).
2.  **Brain**: n8n (hosting the AI Agents & Logic).
3.  **CRM**: GoHighLevel (for SMS/Email communication).
4.  **Operations**: Dispatch Software (e.g., Jobber/Housecall Pro) - *To be integrated.*

### Phase 1: The "Instant Quote" Engine (Priority 1)
Instead of a "Contact Us" form that goes into a black hole, we build a **Dynamic Pricing Agent**.

**Workflow:**
1.  **User Action**: Enters "3 Bedrooms, 2500 sq ft, Deep Clean" on your website.
2.  **Astro**: Sends JSON payload to n8n Webhook.
3.  **n8n Agent**: 
    *   Calculates price range (e.g., "$180 - $220").
    *   Checks availability (optional).
    *   Creates/Updates Contact in GHL.
    *   Adds "High Value" tag if location = "Mountain Brook" or "The Ledges".
4.  **Response**: 
    *   **Immediate SMS**: "Hi [Name], your estimate for your home in Jones Valley is $180-$220. Booking link: [Link]"
    *   **Email**: Detailed breakdown with "Pet Friendly" reassurance (since we know you have that asset).

### Phase 2: The "Review Reactivation" Loop
1.  **Trigger**: Job marked "Complete" in Dispatch.
2.  **n8n Agent**: Waits 2 hours.
3.  **Check**: "Is client happy?" (verified via quick SMS check-in).
4.  **Action**: 
    *   If Happy: Send Google Review deep link specific to their Location (e.g., if Huntsville, send Huntsville GMB).
    *   If Unhappy: Alert Todd/Christen immediately (Slack/SMS) to fix it before they post publicly.

## 3. Immediate Action Plan (Next 48 Hours)

1.  **Frontend**: Add a "Get Instant Quote" button to the Hero section of all 200+ pages (Astro component update).
2.  **Middleware**: Create the `n8n` workflow to handle the quote logic.
3.  **Backend**: Configure GHL snapshots to receive these specific tags.

### Required Decisions
-   **Pricing Logic**: I need your base pricing formula (e.g., $0.xx per sq ft or per room rates).
-   **n8n Access**: I see `n8n` tools available. Shall I start building the "Instant Quote" workflow directly?
