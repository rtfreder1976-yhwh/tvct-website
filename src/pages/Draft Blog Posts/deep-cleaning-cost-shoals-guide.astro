          If you're searching for deep cleaning services in the Shoals area—whether you're in Florence, Muscle Shoals, Tuscumbia, or Sheffield—you've probably wondered what it's going to cost. The honest answer is: it depends. But we're going to break down exactly what affects pricing, what you should expect to pay, and how to get the best value for your money in the Quad Cities.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">What Is Deep Cleaning vs. Regular Cleaning?</h2>

        <p>
          Before we talk numbers, let's clarify what deep cleaning actually means. Regular cleaning—your typical weekly or biweekly service—maintains a home that's already clean. Surfaces get wiped, floors get mopped, bathrooms get scrubbed. It keeps things presentable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deep cleaning goes much further. It targets the grime that builds up over months or years in places you rarely think about: inside the oven, behind the toilet, on top of ceiling fan blades, inside window tracks, under the refrigerator. It's the reset button for your home.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Shoals area, where humidity can encourage mold growth and Alabama red clay seems to get everywhere, deep cleaning addresses problems specific to our region. Homes in Florence near the Tennessee River or Muscle Shoals near Wilson Dam often deal with moisture-related buildup that requires extra attention.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Deep Cleaning Costs in the Shoals: What to Expect</h2>

        <p>
          Based on current market rates in the Quad Cities area, here's what homeowners typically pay for professional deep cleaning:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">By Home Size</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li><strong>1 Bedroom / Studio (under 800 sq ft):</strong> $150–$225</li>
          <li><strong>2 Bedroom (800–1,200 sq ft):</strong> $200–$275</li>
          <li><strong>3 Bedroom (1,200–1,800 sq ft):</strong> $275–$375</li>
          <li><strong>4 Bedroom (1,800–2,500 sq ft):</strong> $350–$450</li>
          <li><strong>5+ Bedroom (2,500+ sq ft):</strong> $450–$600+</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These ranges apply across Florence, Muscle Shoals, Tuscumbia, and Sheffield. Prices in nearby areas like Killen, Rogersville, and Leighton typically fall within the same range, though some companies charge travel fees for locations outside the immediate Quad Cities.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">By Hourly Rate</h3>

        <p>
          Some cleaning services charge by the hour rather than by the project. In the Shoals area, expect:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li><strong>Solo cleaner:</strong> $35–$50 per hour</li>
          <li><strong>Two-person team:</strong> $60–$90 per hour</li>
          <li><strong>Professional crew (3+):</strong> $90–$125 per hour</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A deep clean typically takes 4–8 hours depending on home size and condition. At The Valley Clean Team, we prefer flat-rate pricing so there are no surprises—the price we quote is the price you pay.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Factors That Affect Deep Cleaning Cost</h2>

        <p>
          Why such a wide range in pricing? Several factors determine where your home falls on the spectrum:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">1. Time Since Last Deep Clean</h3>

        <p>
          A home that gets deep cleaned quarterly is much faster to service than one that hasn't been professionally cleaned in years. Built-up grease in the kitchen, soap scum in showers, and dust accumulation all add time—and therefore cost.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your Florence or Muscle Shoals home hasn't had professional cleaning in over a year, expect pricing toward the higher end of the range.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">2. Number of Bathrooms</h3>

        <p>
          Bathrooms take the most time during deep cleaning. Tile grout, shower doors, behind toilets, exhaust fans, under vanities—there's a lot of detail work. Homes with 3+ bathrooms typically cost $50–$100 more than comparable homes with fewer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">3. Kitchen Condition</h3>

        <p>
          The kitchen is usually the second most labor-intensive area. Inside the oven, refrigerator coils, range hood filters, cabinet fronts, and behind appliances all require attention. Kitchens with heavy grease buildup can add an hour or more to the job.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">4. Pets</h3>

        <p>
          We love animals—many Shoals families have dogs and cats—but pets add work. Pet hair accumulates in corners, on furniture, and in vents. Pet-related odors may require extra treatment. Most services add $25–$75 for homes with pets.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">5. Clutter Level</h3>

        <p>
          Professional cleaners need to access surfaces to clean them. Homes with significant clutter require more time to work around items. Some services charge extra; others ask clients to declutter before the appointment.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">6. Add-On Services</h3>

        <p>
          Standard deep cleaning covers the essentials. Additional services that often cost extra include:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-2 mb-8">
          <li>Interior window cleaning: $50–$150</li>
          <li>Inside refrigerator/freezer: $25–$50</li>
          <li>Inside oven cleaning: $25–$50</li>
          <li>Laundry and folding: $25–$50 per load</li>
          <li>Organizing services: $40–$75 per hour</li>
          <li>Garage cleaning: $75–$200</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">What's Included in a Deep Cleaning?</h2>

        <p>
          A thorough deep cleaning in the Shoals should include everything in a standard cleaning, plus:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Kitchen</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Inside microwave</li>
          <li>Exterior of all appliances</li>
          <li>Cabinet fronts wiped down</li>
          <li>Inside drawers and cabinets (upon request)</li>
          <li>Range hood and filters</li>
          <li>Behind and under appliances (where accessible)</li>
          <li>Backsplash detailed</li>
          <li>Sink and faucet descaled</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Bathrooms</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Grout scrubbing</li>
          <li>Shower door tracks</li>
          <li>Behind and around toilet base</li>
          <li>Exhaust fan cleaning</li>
          <li>Light fixture cleaning</li>
          <li>Medicine cabinet interior (upon request)</li>
          <li>Tile walls wiped down</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Throughout the Home</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>All baseboards wiped</li>
          <li>Ceiling fans and light fixtures</li>
          <li>Window sills and tracks</li>
          <li>Door frames and handles</li>
          <li>Air vents dusted</li>
          <li>Switch plates and outlets wiped</li>
          <li>Blinds dusted</li>
          <li>Under furniture (where accessible)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Shoals-Specific Considerations</h2>

        <p>
          Living in the Quad Cities comes with unique cleaning challenges:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Humidity and Moisture</h3>

        <p>
          The Tennessee River runs right through our area. Florence sits along the banks, and Muscle Shoals, Tuscumbia, and Sheffield are all river-adjacent. This proximity means higher humidity, which can lead to mold and mildew in bathrooms, closets, and basements.
        </p>

        <p>
          A quality deep clean addresses moisture-related buildup. Bathroom exhaust fans get cleaned and tested, shower caulk gets inspected, and problem areas get flagged before they become major issues.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Alabama Red Clay</h3>

        <p>
          That distinctive red soil gets tracked into homes throughout the Shoals. It stains grout, embeds in carpet, and clings to baseboards. Professional deep cleaning can address clay buildup that regular cleaning doesn't fully remove.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Older Homes</h3>

        <p>
          The Shoals has beautiful historic homes, especially in downtown Florence and the older sections of Tuscumbia and Sheffield. Older homes often have details—crown molding, built-in shelving, original hardwood—that require careful attention. Quality cleaning services adjust their approach for these architectural features.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">How to Get the Best Value</h2>

        <p>
          Price matters, but value matters more. Here's how to ensure you're getting quality for your money:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Check Insurance and Bonding</h3>

        <p>
          Any professional cleaning service should carry liability insurance. At The Valley Clean Team, we carry $2 million in liability coverage—not the bare minimum $500,000 that many services carry. This protects your home and your belongings.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Ask About Consistency</h3>

        <p>
          Will you get the same cleaning team each visit? Consistency matters for quality. Our "same team, every time" policy means your cleaners know your home, your preferences, and your standards.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Look for Transparent Pricing</h3>

        <p>
          Be wary of quotes that seem vague or companies that won't provide written estimates. The price you're quoted should be the price you pay—no hidden fees, no surprise charges.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Read Local Reviews</h3>

        <p>
          Check Google reviews, Facebook, and local community groups. Shoals residents are quick to share both positive and negative experiences with local service providers.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-8 mb-4">Consider Bundling</h3>

        <p>
          Many cleaning services offer discounts when you bundle deep cleaning with ongoing service. Starting with a deep clean and transitioning to regular maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach long-term.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">When Should You Get a Deep Clean?</h2>

        <p>
          Most Shoals homeowners benefit from professional deep cleaning in these situations:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li><strong>Seasonally:</strong> Spring and fall are popular times for deep cleaning—once before summer entertaining season and once before holiday gatherings</li>
          <li><strong>After construction or renovation:</strong> Even with contractor cleanup, fine dust settles everywhere</li>
          <li><strong>Before moving in:</strong> Start fresh in your new Florence, Muscle Shoals, or Tuscumbia home</li>
          <li><strong>After illness:</strong> Reset the home after flu season or other illness</li>
          <li><strong>Before hosting guests:</strong> Make sure every corner is guest-ready</li>
          <li><strong>When switching to regular cleaning service:</strong> Deep clean first, then maintain</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-6 mb-3">How long does a deep cleaning take?</h3>
        <p>
          For a typical 3-bedroom home in the Shoals, expect 4–6 hours with a two-person team. Larger homes or those with heavy buildup may take longer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-6 mb-3">Do I need to be home during the cleaning?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Many of our Shoals clients provide a code, key, or smart lock access. Our teams are background-checked, insured, and bonded.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-6 mb-3">How often should I get a deep cleaning?</h3>
        <p>
          Most homes benefit from deep cleaning 2–4 times per year. If you have pets, allergies, or high household traffic, quarterly deep cleaning is ideal.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-6 mb-3">What's the difference between deep cleaning and move-out cleaning?</h3>
        <p>
          Move-out cleaning is a specific type of deep cleaning focused on preparing a property for the next tenant or buyer. It often includes inside all cabinets and closets, even if empty.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Why the Shoals Trusts The Valley Clean Team</h2>
