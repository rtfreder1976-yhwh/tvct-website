        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          You hired a cleaning service to make your life easier. Now you find yourself walking through the house after they leave, running your finger across the same dusty shelf, noticing the same streak on the bathroom mirror, seeing that the baseboards in the hallway haven't been touched. Again.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          It's frustrating. You're paying for professional cleaning. You shouldn't have to follow behind them with a checklist. But here you are, wondering if this is normal, if you're being too picky, or if you simply hired the wrong company.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Let's sort through this. Because while some issues are fixable with better communication, others signal it's time to move on.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">First: Define "Missing Spots"</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Before taking action, clarify what's actually happening. Not all missed spots are equal.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Is It Actually in the Scope?</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Many cleaning services have tiers. "Standard cleaning" typically includes surface-level work—counters, floors, toilets, sinks, visible areas. It usually doesn't include:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Inside cabinets and drawers</li>
          <li>Baseboards (unless specified)</li>
          <li>Ceiling fans and light fixtures</li>
          <li>Window tracks and sills</li>
          <li>Behind or under appliances</li>
          <li>Interior of refrigerators and ovens</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you're frustrated that your baseboards never get wiped, but you signed up for standard cleaning, the issue isn't "missed spots"—it's a scope mismatch. You may need deep cleaning, or specific add-ons.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Action step:</strong> Review exactly what your service includes. Ask for it in writing if you don't have it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Is It Inconsistent Execution?</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          This is different. If your agreement says "clean all bathroom mirrors" and one gets missed regularly, that's a quality problem. Same if the kitchen counters are sometimes spotless and sometimes left with crumbs.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Inconsistency usually points to one of three things:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Lack of a checklist:</strong> The cleaners are working from memory, not a system</li>
          <li><strong>Time pressure:</strong> They're rushing to get to the next job</li>
          <li><strong>Staff rotation:</strong> Different people with different standards</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Is It the Same Spot Every Time?</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If the same areas are consistently neglected—same corner, same shelf, same bathroom—there might be an access issue they haven't mentioned. Maybe there's clutter blocking the area. Maybe it's hard to reach. Maybe they're uncertain whether to move your belongings.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Or maybe they're just not thorough. But it's worth ruling out practical reasons first.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Step 1: Give Direct, Specific Feedback</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Many clients, especially in Huntsville, Nashville, Birmingham, and other Southern cities, feel awkward giving negative feedback. We're polite. We don't want to seem demanding. But here's the thing: <strong>good cleaning companies want to know when something's wrong.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The key is being specific. "The cleaning wasn't great" doesn't help. "The bathroom mirror in the master bath has streaks, the kitchen baseboards were skipped, and there's still dust on the ceiling fan in the living room" gives them something to work with.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">How to Give Feedback That Works</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Be timely:</strong> Report issues within 24 hours of the cleaning</li>
          <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Room, item, what was missed</li>
          <li><strong>Take photos:</strong> Visual evidence prevents misunderstandings</li>
          <li><strong>Use their preferred channel:</strong> Text, email, app—whatever they monitor</li>
          <li><strong>Be factual, not emotional:</strong> "The counters still had crumbs" not "I can't believe they left this mess"</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          A professional company will respond promptly, apologize sincerely, and offer to make it right—usually by sending someone back to address the issues.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Step 2: Watch What Happens Next</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Their response tells you everything about the company's quality.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Good Signs</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Quick acknowledgment of your feedback</li>
          <li>Genuine apology without excuses</li>
          <li>Offer to come back and fix it at no charge</li>
          <li>Explanation of what they'll do to prevent it next time</li>
          <li>Follow-through: the same issues don't recur</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Red Flags</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Defensiveness: "That's not what we do" or "We always clean that area"</li>
          <li>Blame-shifting: "Our cleaner said there was too much clutter"</li>
          <li>Minimizing: "It's just a small thing"</li>
          <li>Slow or no response</li>
          <li>The same problems continue after feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          A company that's defensive about criticism isn't going to improve. A company that genuinely wants to do better will show it through action.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Step 3: Give It Three Visits</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          One missed spot doesn't condemn a company. Even the best teams have off days. What matters is the pattern.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's a fair approach: after giving feedback, watch the next three cleaning visits.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>First visit after feedback:</strong> Did they address the specific issues you raised?</li>
          <li><strong>Second visit:</strong> Are they maintaining the improvement? Any new missed spots?</li>
          <li><strong>Third visit:</strong> Has the overall quality stabilized at an acceptable level?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you see improvement after your feedback and consistent quality in visits two and three, you've found a company that takes feedback seriously. That's valuable.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If the same problems persist—or new problems appear—despite feedback, it's time to move on.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">When to Cut Your Losses</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Some situations don't warrant three more tries:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Immediate Deal-Breakers</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Damage to your property</strong> that they don't acknowledge or address</li>
          <li><strong>Trust issues:</strong> Missing items, unauthorized access, people you didn't expect</li>
          <li><strong>Hostility:</strong> Rudeness from cleaners or management</li>
          <li><strong>No-shows</strong> without communication</li>
          <li><strong>Consistent, severe quality failures:</strong> Not minor misses, but major areas untouched</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          These aren't "feedback and try again" situations. These are "find a new company today" situations.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Gradual Deal-Breakers</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Persistent missed spots despite repeated feedback</li>
          <li>Declining quality over time</li>
          <li>Communication becoming harder</li>
          <li>Price increases without quality improvements</li>
          <li>Constant cleaner rotation (you never see the same person)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          These suggest systemic problems that aren't going to fix themselves. The company either lacks systems, lacks management attention, or lacks the commitment to quality that makes a service worth paying for.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">How to Find a Better Cleaning Service</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you've decided to switch, here's what to look for in your next cleaning company, whether you're in Madison, Hampton Cove, Mountain Brook, Belle Meade, or anywhere in our service area:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Ask About Their System</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          "What's your cleaning process?" should have a detailed answer. Good companies use checklists. At The Valley Clean Team, we use a 49-point checklist—every item gets done, every time. That's how you prevent missed spots.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Ask About Team Consistency</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          "Will I have the same cleaner each visit?" Consistent teams learn your home. They know where the dust collects, which areas you care about most, where everything goes. Rotating staff means relearning every visit.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Check Their Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          "What happens if I'm not satisfied?" The answer should be immediate and unconditional. We guarantee our work—if you're not happy, we come back and make it right. No questions, no charge.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Verify Insurance</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Ask for proof of liability insurance. We carry $2 million in coverage—that's real protection for your home. Many companies carry the bare minimum or none at all.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Read Reviews Carefully</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Look at recent reviews, especially negative ones. How did the company respond? Do customers mention consistency? Do they specifically praise thoroughness? That's what you want.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Conversation You Need to Have</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you're not ready to switch but want things to improve, here's a template for a productive conversation with your current company:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-[#FFA985] pl-6 my-8 italic text-gray-700">
          "I want to give some feedback about recent cleanings. I've noticed [specific issues] happening consistently. I want to keep working with you, but I need these areas addressed. Can you tell me what will change going forward?"
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          This approach is clear, constructive, and gives them the opportunity to improve. Their response will tell you whether they're worth sticking with.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Prevention: Setting Up Success From the Start</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you're just hiring a cleaning service—or switching to a new one—set expectations clearly from day one:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Do a walkthrough:</strong> Show them your home, point out areas that matter most to you</li>
          <li><strong>Get the scope in writing:</strong> Know exactly what's included and what's extra</li>
          <li><strong>Ask for a checklist:</strong> What items are they committing to clean each visit?</li>
          <li><strong>Discuss access:</strong> Where can they move things? What should they avoid?</li>
          <li><strong>Establish feedback channels:</strong> How should you communicate if there's an issue?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Upfront clarity prevents most problems. Companies that resist this clarity are ones to avoid.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Missed spots happen. What matters is how your cleaning company handles it when they do.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Give specific feedback. Watch the response. Track whether things improve over three visits. If they do, you've found a keeper. If they don't, it's time to find a company that values your business enough to earn it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          You're paying for clean. You deserve clean. Don't settle for less.
