// FAQ Schema
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is post-construction cleaning?",
    answer: "Post-construction cleaning is a specialized deep cleaning service performed after construction, renovation, or remodeling work is completed. It removes construction dust, debris, paint splatters, adhesive residue, and other materials left behind by contractors. The goal is to make the space safe, clean, and move-in ready."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does post-construction cleaning cost?",
    answer: "Post-construction cleaning typically starts at $300 for smaller projects. Pricing depends on the size of the space, type of construction (new build vs. renovation), amount of debris, and specific cleaning requirements. We provide custom quotes after understanding your project's scope. Most residential post-construction cleans range from $300-$800."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I schedule post-construction cleaning?",
    answer: "Schedule post-construction cleaning after all construction work is complete, including painting, flooring, and fixture installation. The space should be free of workers and major debris should be removed by the construction crew. We handle the fine dust, residue, and detail cleaning that makes the space truly move-in ready."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does post-construction cleaning take?",
    answer: "Post-construction cleaning typically takes 4-10 hours depending on the size of the space and extent of construction. A single-room renovation might take 3-4 hours, while a full new home build can take 8-12 hours or may require multiple visits. We'll provide a time estimate based on your specific project."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you remove construction debris and trash?",
    answer: "We remove light debris, dust, and small construction waste. Large debris, lumber scraps, and major trash removal should be handled by your construction crew before we arrive. We focus on the detailed cleaning - dust, residue, and making surfaces spotless - rather than hauling away construction materials."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove paint splatters and adhesive residue?",
    answer: "Yes! We're experienced in removing paint overspray, dried paint splatters, sticker residue, adhesive marks, caulk residue, and grout haze. We use appropriate techniques and products for each surface type to remove these without causing damage."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean windows after construction?",
    answer: "Yes, window cleaning is included in our post-construction service. We remove construction film, dust, paint splatters, and sticker residue from all windows, leaving them streak-free. We also clean window tracks, sills, and frames which often collect significant dust during construction."
  },
  {
    question: "Is post-construction dust harmful?",
    answer: "Yes, construction dust can contain harmful particles including silica, drywall dust, wood particles, and other irritants. This dust gets everywhere - in cabinets, HVAC systems, and on every surface. Professional post-construction cleaning ensures thorough removal of these particles, making the space safe to occupy."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean inside cabinets and closets after construction?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Construction dust penetrates everywhere, including inside cabinets, closets, drawers, and storage spaces. We clean all interior surfaces to ensure no dust is left behind when you move in your belongings."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean after a small renovation or just one room?",
    answer: "Yes! We clean after projects of all sizes - from single bathroom remodels to full home builds. Even small renovations create significant dust that spreads throughout the home. We can focus on the renovated area or include adjacent spaces affected by construction dust."
