    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between regular and deep cleaning?",

    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: "Should I deep clean before starting recurring service?",
      answer: "We highly recommend it! Starting with a deep clean gives our team a clean baseline to maintain. Many Athens customers book a deep clean first, then switch to weekly or biweekly maintenance cleaning."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you serve all of Limestone County?",
      answer: "Yes! We provide deep cleaning throughout Athens and Limestone County including Tanner, Elkmont, Ardmore, Belle Mina, Clements, and all surrounding areas."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I schedule deep cleaning?",
