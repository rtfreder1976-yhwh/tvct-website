      question: "Why does my new Florence home need post-construction cleaning?",
      answer: "Even quality builders leave behind fine drywall dust that embeds everywhere—inside cabinets, HVAC systems, window tracks, and surfaces. This dust circulates through your home for months if not properly removed. Builder cleaning typically addresses only visible surfaces, not the detailed cleaning needed for a truly move-in ready home."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does post-construction cleaning cost in Florence?",
      answer: "Post-construction cleaning in Florence typically starts at $350 for smaller homes and renovations. Average new construction homes (1,800-2,500 sq ft) typically cost $400-$600. Larger custom homes may cost $600-$800+. Pricing depends on square footage, construction type, and condition. Call (256) 826-1100 for a free quote."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between builder cleaning and professional post-construction cleaning?",
      answer: "Builder cleaning is basic—sweeping floors, wiping visible surfaces, removing large debris. Professional post-construction cleaning is thorough—inside every cabinet, every HVAC vent, window tracks, appliance interiors, light fixtures, and all the places where fine dust settles and hides."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you serve new construction in Muscle Shoals and Sheffield?",
      answer: "Yes! We serve new construction and renovation projects throughout the Shoals area including Florence, Muscle Shoals, Sheffield, Tuscumbia, Killen, and Rogersville. The entire Shoals region has significant new home construction we regularly service."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I schedule post-construction cleaning?",
      answer: "Schedule after all construction is complete but before moving in or final walkthrough. Ideally, book 1-2 weeks before your move-in date. We can also clean after the builder's crew has done their basic cleaning—we'll address everything they missed."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does post-construction cleaning take?",
      answer: "Typical Florence homes (1,800-2,500 sq ft) take 6-10 hours for thorough post-construction cleaning. Larger homes or those with extensive custom features may take 10-14+ hours. We provide time estimates with your quote."
