    {
      question: "How much does recurring maid service cost in Florence?",
      answer: "Recurring maid service in Florence starts at $125 per visit for weekly cleaning. Biweekly service starts slightly higher since more cleaning is needed between visits. Pricing depends on home size and frequency. Call 256-826-1100 for your personalized quote."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I have the same cleaner each visit?",
      answer: "Yes! We assign the same team to your home for every visit. This means they learn your preferences, know your home's layout, and provide consistent results. You'll see familiar, trusted faces each time."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between weekly and biweekly cleaning?",
      answer: "Weekly cleaning keeps your home consistently spotless with lighter cleaning each visit. Biweekly works well for smaller households or those who maintain tidiness between visits. Monthly is best suited for light maintenance or vacation homes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I skip or reschedule a cleaning?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Life happens, and we understand. You can skip or reschedule cleanings with 24-48 hours notice at no charge. We'll work with you to find a time that fits your schedule."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you serve the UNA area?",
      answer: "Yes! We provide recurring maid service throughout Florence including near UNA, Downtown Florence, the Historic District, and all Lauderdale County neighborhoods. We also serve the wider Shoals area."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I start with a deep clean?",
      answer: "We recommend it! Starting with a deep clean gives our team a clean baseline to maintain. This makes recurring visits more efficient and ensures better results. Many Florence customers book a one-time deep clean, then transition to weekly or biweekly service."
