  localContext={[
    "Florence families are busy. Between work, kids' activities at the Florence Sportsplex, UNA events, and enjoying the Tennessee River, there's little time left for housework. Our weekly cleaning service is designed specifically for Shoals area families who want to spend their weekends at Wilson Dam, not scrubbing bathrooms.",
    "Many of our weekly cleaning clients are professionals working at North Alabama Medical Center, UNA faculty, or families with children in Florence City Schools. They appreciate coming home every week to a consistently clean house without having to manage the cleaning themselves. We work around your schedule, arriving the same day and time each week so cleaning becomes one less thing to think about.",
    "From the historic neighborhoods near downtown Florence to the newer developments in Killen and Rogersville, our weekly service keeps Shoals area homes in pristine condition year-round. The beauty of weekly service is that messes never have a chance to build up - we stay on top of dirt, dust, and grime so your home always feels fresh and welcoming."

    },
    {
      question: "Is weekly service better than biweekly for Florence homes?",
      answer: "It depends on your household. Weekly service is ideal for busy families with kids or pets, homes that see a lot of traffic, or anyone who wants their house consistently spotless. Weekly cleaning prevents buildup and keeps your Florence home in pristine condition year-round. We can help you determine the best frequency during your consultation."
