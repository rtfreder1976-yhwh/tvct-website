    question: "What makes Shoals Creek homes different from other Florence neighborhoods?",
    answer: "Shoals Creek is Florence's premier golf community, centered around the 18-hole Shoals Creek Golf Course. Properties here typically range from 2,000 to 4,000+ square feet with open floor plans, golf course views, covered patios, and modern construction (mostly 2000s-2010s). The community attracts retirees, successful professionals, and families who want low-maintenance living in a country club setting."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle homes with golf course frontage and large outdoor spaces?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Shoals Creek homes have golf course views, covered patios, screened porches, and outdoor entertaining areas. We clean patio furniture, outdoor surfaces, and ensure your indoor-outdoor living spaces are pristine. While we focus on interiors, we tidy outdoor areas to keep your entertaining spaces guest-ready."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer service while we're at work or traveling?",
    answer: "Yes! This is very popular with Shoals Creek's busy professionals and retirees who travel. You can provide us with a key, garage code, or smart lock access. We'll clean while you're away and lock up securely when finished. Fully bonded and insured means you can trust us with access to your home."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in regular maintenance cleaning?",
    answer: "Our regular service (weekly or bi-weekly) includes all living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and tidying. We focus on the areas that busy families and active retirees need maintained. You'll have the same team each visit who learns your home and preferences - consistent, reliable service."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help prepare for hosting golf outings or entertaining guests?",
    answer: "Definitely! Shoals Creek residents frequently host golf buddies, family visits, and entertaining events. We offer pre-event deep cleaning to make sure your home is spotless for guests, and post-event cleanup to restore everything to perfection. Same-day service available when you're in a pinch."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle open floor plan homes?",
    answer: "Shoals Creek homes often feature open-concept living with great rooms combining kitchen, dining, and living spaces - perfect for entertaining. Our teams are experienced with these modern layouts. We clean efficiently while respecting your furniture arrangement and ensuring every surface in the open space shines."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer deep cleaning for seasonal maintenance?",
    answer: "Yes! Many Shoals Creek homeowners want deep cleaning seasonally - spring refresh, pre-holiday preparation, or post-summer recovery. We include baseboards, ceiling fans, windows, appliances, and detailed attention to areas that don't get cleaned during regular maintenance. Perfect for keeping your home in top condition."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does cleaning cost in Shoals Creek?",
    answer: "Most Shoals Creek homes (2,000-3,500 sq ft) range from $200-$400 for regular cleaning, depending on size and frequency. Deep cleaning is typically $300-$500. Recurring clients receive preferred pricing. Call 256-826-1100 for a customized quote based on your specific home and needs."
