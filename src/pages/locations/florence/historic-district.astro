    question: "How do you clean historic homes without damaging original features?",
    answer: "We use gentle, preservation-safe cleaning methods specifically designed for historic materials. Our team is trained in caring for original hardwood floors, plaster walls, antique fixtures, and period details. We avoid harsh chemicals that can damage vintage finishes, use pH-balanced products safe for old wood and metals, and employ gentle techniques that clean without causing wear to irreplaceable surfaces."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean around valuable antiques and family heirlooms?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many Walnut Street homes contain antique furniture, heirloom pieces, and valuable collections that require special care. We never move antiques without permission, use microfiber cloths to prevent scratches, understand proper dusting techniques for different materials, and treat every item as irreplaceable. Your treasures receive the respect they deserve."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your cleaning products safe for old hardwood floors?",
    answer: "Yes! We use wood floor cleaners specifically formulated for antique and original hardwoods. These products clean without stripping protective finishes, don't leave residue that dulls the natural patina, and are pH-balanced to prevent damage to aging wood. We understand that original floors are a key feature of historic homes and treat them accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you understand Victorian and historic home architecture?",
    answer: "We do! Walnut Street's historic homes feature unique architectural elements - crown molding, ceiling medallions, transom windows, pocket doors, wainscoting, and built-in cabinetry. Our teams are experienced cleaning these details carefully, accessing high features safely, and maintaining the character that makes these homes special. We appreciate the history we're helping preserve."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around historic plaster walls and delicate surfaces?",
    answer: "Definitely. Historic plaster walls require gentler cleaning than modern drywall. We avoid excessive moisture that can damage plaster, use appropriate cleaning methods for painted versus wallpapered surfaces, understand how to clean around original trim without causing damage, and respect the delicate nature of century-old construction materials."
  },
  {
    question: "What about cleaning historic bathrooms with original fixtures?",
    answer: "We love cleaning historic bathrooms! From clawfoot tubs to pedestal sinks and vintage tile, we use cleaning products and techniques appropriate for antique plumbing fixtures. We avoid abrasives that can scratch porcelain, use gentle cleaners safe for vintage chrome and brass, and understand how to clean original tile without damaging grout or period details."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer regular service for historic home maintenance?",
    answer: "Yes! Regular cleaning is actually beneficial for historic homes - it prevents dust buildup that can damage finishes, maintains original surfaces in better condition, catches small maintenance issues before they become major problems, and keeps your investment protected. Weekly or bi-weekly service with the same team ensures consistent, careful attention."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does historic home cleaning cost in the Walnut Street district?",
    answer: "Most Walnut Street historic homes (1,800-3,500 sq ft) range from $200-$450 for regular cleaning, depending on size and condition. Deep cleaning for homes that haven't been professionally maintained can be higher. We provide customized quotes after seeing your specific home and understanding its unique features. Call 256-826-1100 for a consultation."

            The Walnut Street Historic District represents Florence's most architecturally significant neighborhood - a stunning collection of Victorian, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and early 20th century homes that tell the story of Alabama's prosperous Gilded Age. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this neighborhood features homes dating from the 1850s through the 1930s, many meticulously preserved by owners who understand their stewardship of history.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            These aren't ordinary houses. Walnut Street homes feature original heart pine hardwood floors that have witnessed generations, hand-carved woodwork and crown molding, plaster walls with century-old artistry, stained glass windows, pocket doors, built-in cabinetry, and architectural details you simply cannot find in modern construction. Properties typically range from charming 1,800 sq ft cottages to grand 4,000+ sq ft mansions, valued from $200,000 to over $600,000.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Walnut Street homeowners include professors from nearby UNA, healthcare professionals, attorneys, artists, and families committed to historic preservation. They're people who chose character over cookie-cutter, who appreciate the irreplaceable value of original craftsmanship, and who need cleaning services that understand the difference between historic and merely old.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            The Valley Clean Team respects what you're preserving. We use gentle, preservation-safe products and techniques designed specifically for historic materials. Your original floors, antique fixtures, and period details receive the careful attention that protects your investment in history while keeping your home beautifully maintained.
