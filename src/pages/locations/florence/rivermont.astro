  {
    question: "What areas of Rivermont do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of Rivermont and surrounding Florence neighborhoods. This includes homes along Rivermont Drive, Rivermont Estates, properties near McFarland Park, areas close to the Tennessee River, and residential streets throughout this established Florence community. From ranch homes to larger custom builds, we clean Rivermont homes with care."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work for Rivermont homes?",
    answer: "Most Rivermont homes range from $150-$325 for regular cleaning, depending on square footage and service frequency. The average Rivermont home (1,800-2,800 sq ft) typically falls in the $175-$275 range for regular service. Deep cleaning runs approximately 50% more. We offer preferred pricing for recurring weekly and bi-weekly clients. Call 256-826-1100 for your personalized quote."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean homes with river views and outdoor living spaces?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Rivermont homes feature screened porches, covered patios, and outdoor entertaining areas that take advantage of the beautiful Tennessee River setting. We clean these spaces as part of our service, sweeping porches, tidying outdoor furniture, and keeping your entertaining areas guest-ready."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you accommodate busy professional schedules?",
    answer: "Yes! Rivermont is home to many professionals who commute to Huntsville, work at local businesses, or manage demanding careers. We offer flexible scheduling including early morning, daytime while you're at work, or times that work around your life. Your career shouldn't mean you don't have time for a clean home."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve homes near McFarland Park and the river?",
    answer: "Definitely! We clean homes throughout the Rivermont area including those near McFarland Park, properties with Tennessee River access, and homes along the scenic routes near the water. These properties often have unique features - outdoor spaces, humidity considerations, and lake-effect dust - that we understand and address."
  },
  {
    question: "What about larger custom homes in Rivermont?",
    answer: "Rivermont includes some of Florence's most desirable custom homes with premium finishes. We're experienced cleaning larger homes with hardwood floors, granite counters, custom cabinetry, and high-end fixtures. We use appropriate products and techniques that protect and maintain these quality materials."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer recurring cleaning service for Rivermont homes?",
    answer: "Yes, recurring service is our specialty! Most Rivermont clients choose weekly or bi-weekly cleaning to maintain their homes consistently. You'll have the same dedicated team every visit who learns your preferences and maintains your standards. Recurring clients also receive preferred pricing."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book Rivermont cleaning?",
    answer: "For regular recurring service, a few days' notice is typically sufficient. For deep cleaning or move-in/out service, we recommend 3-5 days when possible. Same-day service may be available for urgent needs. Call 256-826-1100 to check current availability for Rivermont."

            Rivermont sits in one of Florence's most scenic locations, where established neighborhoods meet the natural beauty of the Tennessee River. Just minutes from McFarland Park's walking trails, boat launches, and picnic areas, Rivermont residents enjoy the best of Shoals living - a connected community with easy access to downtown Florence, UNA, and the recreational opportunities that draw people to northwest Alabama.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Homes in Rivermont reflect the neighborhood's appeal. You'll find well-maintained ranch homes from the 1970s-80s alongside newer custom builds that take advantage of the area's character. Properties range from 1,600 to over 3,500 square feet, with many featuring covered porches, screened sunrooms, and outdoor living spaces perfect for enjoying the area's mild climate.

          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Rivermont draws professionals who commute to Huntsville, retirees who appreciate the area's pace of life, and families who value Florence's excellent schools and community feel. Life here is active - weekends at McFarland Park, dinners downtown, evenings on the porch. Who wants to spend that precious free time scrubbing bathrooms?
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
