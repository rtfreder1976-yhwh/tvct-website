    question: "Do you clean historic homes near Ivy Green and downtown Tuscumbia?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Tuscumbia's historic homes—from the 19th-century residences near Ivy Green to the beautifully preserved properties in the National Register Historic District—require specialized care. Our team uses gentle, pH-neutral products that protect original hardwood floors, antique fixtures, and architectural details while delivering a thorough clean. We understand the pride Tuscumbia residents take in their historic community."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean before or after Helen Keller Festival events?",
    answer: "Yes! The Helen Keller Festival in June brings thousands of visitors to Tuscumbia, and many residents host out-of-town guests or rent their properties during this time. We offer pre-event deep cleaning to get your home guest-ready and post-event cleaning to restore your home after hosting. The same applies for 'It's a Dickens Christmas, Y'all' and other Tuscumbia festivals throughout the year."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve the entire Quad Cities area?",
    answer: "Yes, we serve all of the Shoals area including Tuscumbia, Florence, Muscle Shoals, and Sheffield. Whether you're in downtown Tuscumbia near Spring Park, in a lakeside home near Wilson Lake, or anywhere else in Colbert County, we deliver the same professional service. Our familiarity with the Quad Cities means we understand each community's unique character."

    question: "What areas of Tuscumbia do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all Tuscumbia neighborhoods including Downtown, the Spring Park area, the Ivy Green district, North Commons, East and West Tuscumbia, Colbert Heights, and Spring Creek. We also serve surrounding communities like Cherokee, Leighton, and Littleville. If you're in Colbert County, we can help."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer Airbnb turnover cleaning in Tuscumbia?",
    answer: "Yes! Tuscumbia's tourism attractions—Ivy Green, the Alabama Music Hall of Fame, Spring Park, and the annual Miracle Worker performances—bring visitors year-round who often stay in vacation rentals. We provide fast, reliable turnover cleaning that keeps your property guest-ready and helps maintain your 5-star reviews. Same-day service is available when scheduling permits."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean my home before I host family for The Miracle Worker performances?",
    answer: "Absolutely. The Miracle Worker performances at Ivy Green from June through July bring families together from across the country. We can deep clean your home before your guests arrive and provide a quick refresh cleaning during their stay if needed. Many Tuscumbia families rely on us to help make their hosting experience stress-free."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean homes near the Tennessee River and Wilson Lake?",
    answer: "Yes, we serve homeowners throughout the Shoals area, including properties near Wilson Lake and the Tennessee River. These homes often see extra traffic during fishing season and summer months. We understand the unique cleaning needs of lakeside properties and can accommodate flexible scheduling for weekend visitors and seasonal residents."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can you provide service in Tuscumbia?",
    answer: "We offer same-day service for Tuscumbia residents when availability permits. For regular recurring service, we typically can begin within a few days of your initial contact. Call us at 256-826-1100 for current availability—we're committed to serving the Shoals community with reliable, responsive service."

          Why the Shoals Trusts The Valley Clean Team
        </h2>

      </div>

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Tuscumbia holds a special place in American history. One of Alabama's oldest towns—incorporated in 1820—this community was named for a Chickasaw chief who welcomed early settlers to the bountiful land near a magnificent spring. It was here, at a modest estate called Ivy Green, that Helen Adams Keller was born in 1880 and would later make her miraculous breakthrough at the water pump with teacher Anne Sullivan. Today, Tuscumbia remains the proud county seat of Colbert County and the historic heart of the Shoals region.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          The Valley Clean Team understands what makes Tuscumbia and the Quad Cities special. This isn't just another collection of small towns—it's a community with deep roots in American transportation history (home to the first railroad west of the Allegheny Mountains in 1830), legendary musical heritage (the Alabama Music Hall of Fame stands on Highway 72), and an enduring commitment to preserving the charm that makes the Shoals unlike anywhere else. From the 48-foot Coldwater Falls cascading through Spring Park to the Victorian-era storefronts of downtown, Tuscumbia blends historic character with genuine Southern hospitality.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Our cleaning service is designed for the families, retirees, and young professionals who call the Shoals home. We serve the historic neighborhoods near the Colbert County Courthouse—a stunning 1909 structure that anchors the National Register Historic District—where beautifully preserved 19th-century homes deserve equally careful cleaning. We clean modern family homes in Spring Creek and Colbert Heights, where busy parents juggle work and Little League schedules. We maintain vacation rentals and guest houses for hosts who welcome visitors drawn by The Miracle Worker performances, the Helen Keller Festival, and the legendary music studios just minutes away.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          The Shoals draws a steady stream of visitors year-round. Music lovers make pilgrimages to nearby FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield—hallowed ground where Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, the Rolling Stones, and countless legends recorded. History enthusiasts tour Ivy Green and Spring Park, especially during the Helen Keller Festival each June and "It's a Dickens Christmas, Y'all" in December. Anglers flock to Wilson Lake and the Tennessee River for some of the Southeast's best bass fishing. For Tuscumbia homeowners, this means hosting out-of-town guests, maintaining rental properties, and keeping homes ready for impromptu visitors who want to experience the magic of this remarkable community.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          As a veteran-owned, women-led business, we bring military precision and genuine care to every Tuscumbia home we clean. Our background-checked team members treat your property with the same respect we'd show our own—whether you live in a charming cottage near downtown, a spacious family home by Spring Creek Golf Course, or a lakeside retreat near the Tennessee River. We understand that in close-knit communities like Tuscumbia, reputation matters. That's why we've built ours on reliability, quality, and the kind of personal service that neighbors recommend to neighbors.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Whether you need weekly cleaning to keep up with a busy household, deep cleaning before your family arrives for festival season, move-out cleaning as you transition to your next chapter, or Airbnb turnover service to keep your rental earning five-star reviews, The Valley Clean Team delivers professional results with small-town values. Our $2 million liability insurance provides peace of mind, and our 100% satisfaction guarantee ensures you're always happy with our work. We're proud to serve Tuscumbia, Florence, Muscle Shoals, Sheffield, and all the communities that make the Shoals such a special place to call home.

            The Colbert County Courthouse anchors a National Register Historic District filled with 19th-century architecture. From the Palace Drugstore ice cream parlor to Coldwater Bookstore and charming boutiques, downtown Tuscumbia preserves the character of a simpler era. Homes in this district often feature original hardwood floors, tall ceilings, and period details that deserve specialized care.

            Tuscumbia's crown jewel features the world's largest man-made natural stone waterfall—Coldwater Falls—where 4.3 million gallons cascade daily over the 48-foot drop. The Princess Im-Mi-Ah-Key fountain shoots water 100 feet high, choreographed to lights and music. Nearby residences enjoy this parkside setting while benefiting from convenient access to downtown amenities.

            The neighborhood surrounding Helen Keller's birthplace—a National Historic Landmark since 1954—features gracious homes on tree-lined streets. The Miracle Worker performances draw visitors each summer, and the Helen Keller Festival transforms the area each June. Homeowners here often host guests and appreciate cleaning service that understands their community's historic significance.
