    question: "What types of homes does The Valley Clean Team service in Heritage Plantation?",
    answer: "We service all home types in Heritage Plantation, from the elegant 2,500 square foot traditional homes to the expansive 5,000+ square foot executive estates. Our team is experienced with the premium finishes, hardwood floors, granite countertops, and custom cabinetry typical of Heritage Plantation properties. Whether your home features a formal living room, chef's kitchen, or multi-level layout, we have the expertise to clean it properly."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle Heritage Plantation's gated community access?",
    answer: "Heritage Plantation homeowners can provide us with gate codes or add our team to their guest list for seamless access. We coordinate arrival times in advance and communicate clearly about scheduling. Your security and convenience are our priorities. Many residents provide garage codes or smart lock access so we can clean while they're at work without any disruption to their day."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer service during weekday work hours?",
    answer: "Absolutely - this is our most popular option for Heritage Plantation's busy professionals. Most residents are executives, engineers, or dual-income families who prefer we clean while they're at the office. Provide us with secure access (key, garage code, or smart lock), and we'll handle everything. You'll come home to a spotless house and actually have time to enjoy your evening with family."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your regular maintenance cleaning for Heritage Plantation homes?",
    answer: "Our regular weekly or bi-weekly service covers all living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchen cleaning. This includes dusting all surfaces, vacuuming carpets and rugs, mopping hardwood and tile floors, cleaning and sanitizing bathrooms, wiping down kitchen surfaces, and general tidying. We pay special attention to high-traffic areas common in family homes. The same dedicated team visits each time, learning your preferences and home layout."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you accommodate homes with pets in Heritage Plantation?",
    answer: "Yes! Many Heritage Plantation families have dogs, cats, or both. Our team members are comfortable working around pets and use only pet-safe, eco-friendly cleaning products. If you prefer we avoid certain areas while pets are present or keep doors closed, just let us know. We understand pets are family members and treat them with the same respect we show your home."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you price cleaning services for Heritage Plantation's larger homes?",
    answer: "We provide custom quotes based on your home's square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, current condition, and service frequency. Heritage Plantation homes typically range from 2,500 to 5,000+ square feet, and our pricing reflects the attention these executive properties deserve. Recurring clients receive preferred rates compared to one-time cleanings. Call us for a free, no-obligation quote specific to your home."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer deep cleaning before hosting events or holidays?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Heritage Plantation homes are perfect for entertaining, and many residents book deep cleans before holiday gatherings, dinner parties, or family visits. Our deep cleaning service goes beyond regular maintenance - we tackle baseboards, ceiling fans, light fixtures, interior windows, appliance exteriors, cabinet fronts, and all those areas that get overlooked in routine cleaning. Book at least a week in advance for holiday periods."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes The Valley Clean Team different from other cleaning services in Madison?",
    answer: "We're veteran-owned with a focus on reliability, professionalism, and attention to detail. Every team member is background-checked, licensed, and insured. You get the same dedicated team every visit - no revolving door of strangers. We use professional-grade, eco-friendly products and our 130+ five-star Google reviews speak to the quality Heritage Plantation families expect. Plus, we offer a 2-hour response guarantee on all inquiries."
