    question: "Do you have experience cleaning waterfront homes in Clift's Cove?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We specialize in cleaning waterfront properties along Wheeler Lake. We understand the unique challenges these homes face - extra dust from outdoor living, humidity concerns, and the constant need to keep your lake views sparkling clean. Our team knows how to care for hardwood floors that may be exposed to humidity, clean large windows without streaks, and ensure your home is always ready for impromptu entertaining by the water."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean our outdoor living spaces and screened porches?",
    answer: "Yes! Clift's Cove homes typically have extensive outdoor living areas - screened porches, patios, and deck spaces that overlook Wheeler Lake. While our primary focus is interior cleaning, we can absolutely clean outdoor furniture, screened porch floors and surfaces, and ensure your indoor-outdoor transition areas are spotless. These spaces get used constantly in a waterfront community, and we help keep them guest-ready."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes with boat docks and lake access areas?",
    answer: "We understand waterfront living means tracking in sand, lake residue, and outdoor debris. Our cleaning includes special attention to entryways, mudrooms, and the transition zones between your dock access and living spaces. We use appropriate products for tile, hardwood, and other flooring that may see more moisture and foot traffic than typical homes."
  },
  {
    question: "What if we use our Clift's Cove home as a vacation or weekend property?",
    answer: "Many Clift's Cove properties serve as second homes or vacation retreats. We offer flexible scheduling perfect for weekend properties - we can clean before your arrival so you walk into a pristine home, or after you leave to prepare for your next visit. We also offer turnover cleaning for owners who rent their waterfront homes. Just give us your schedule and we'll work around it."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean large windows and glass doors with lake views?",
    answer: "Yes! Those stunning Wheeler Lake views deserve crystal-clear windows. We clean interior windows, sliding glass doors, and French doors as part of our deep cleaning service. For regular maintenance cleaning, we address smudges and fingerprints on glass surfaces. We know the whole point of waterfront living is enjoying that view - we make sure nothing obstructs it."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you accommodate homes with 4,000+ square feet?",
    answer: "Clift's Cove features larger luxury homes ranging from 2,500 to 5,000+ square feet, and we're fully equipped to handle them. We send appropriately sized teams based on your home's square footage to ensure thorough cleaning within a reasonable timeframe. Our team leads have experience with large homes and know how to efficiently clean extensive floor plans without sacrificing quality."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in regular cleaning for a waterfront home?",
    answer: "Our regular maintenance service covers all living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens with dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and surface cleaning. For waterfront homes, we pay extra attention to areas that accumulate lake-related dust and debris. You'll have the same team each visit who learns your home's specific needs - from the best way to clean your floors to how you like your lake-view rooms arranged."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer service while we're away at work or traveling?",
    answer: "Yes, this is very popular with Clift's Cove homeowners. You can provide us with a key, garage code, or smart lock access. We'll clean while you're at work, traveling, or enjoying the lake, then lock up securely when finished. Many of our waterfront clients love returning to a clean home after a day on Wheeler Lake - it's the perfect ending to a perfect day."
