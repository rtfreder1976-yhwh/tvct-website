  {
    question: "Do you serve all sections of Bradford Creek?",
    answer: "Yes, we serve every section of Bradford Creek including the original phases near Balch Road and the newer developments. Whether you live in the established homes built in the 1990s or the more recent additions, our team knows the neighborhood well and can accommodate your cleaning needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What size homes do you typically clean in Bradford Creek?",
    answer: "Most Bradford Creek homes range from 2,000 to 3,500 square feet with 3-5 bedrooms. We're experienced with these family-sized homes and price our services accordingly. Whether you have a cozy starter home or a larger property, we can customize our service to fit your needs and budget."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean during school hours while my kids are away?",
    answer: "Absolutely! This is a popular option for Bradford Creek families. Many of our clients are parents who want the house cleaned while kids are at James Clemens, Discovery Middle, or one of the excellent Madison City schools. We'll clean efficiently and be finished before the school bus returns."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes with pets?",
    answer: "Bradford Creek is full of pet-loving families, and we're comfortable working around dogs, cats, and other pets. We use pet-safe cleaning products and can work around your pet's routine. If you prefer, we can clean while pets are kenneled or in a separate room - just let us know your preference."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between regular cleaning and deep cleaning?",
    answer: "Regular cleaning covers your weekly or bi-weekly maintenance needs - all living areas, kitchens, bathrooms, dusting, vacuuming, and mopping. Deep cleaning goes further with baseboards, ceiling fans, inside appliances, window tracks, cabinet fronts, and areas that don't get attention in routine cleaning. We recommend a deep clean seasonally or as a first-time service."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be home during the cleaning?",
    answer: "Not at all! Most Bradford Creek clients provide us with a garage code, key, or smart lock access. We clean while you're at work and lock up securely when finished. Our team members are background-checked and fully insured, so you can trust us in your home."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance do I need to book?",
    answer: "For regular recurring service, we can usually start within a week. For one-time or deep cleaning, we recommend booking 3-5 days ahead, though we do offer same-day service when available. The earlier you book, the better chance you have of getting your preferred time slot."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the cleaning?",
    answer: "Your satisfaction is our priority. If anything doesn't meet your expectations, let us know within 24 hours and we'll come back to make it right at no additional charge. We want Bradford Creek families to be completely happy with our service - that's how we've built our reputation."
