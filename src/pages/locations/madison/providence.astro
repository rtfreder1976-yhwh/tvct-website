    question: "Do you serve all sections of Providence?",
    answer: "Yes, we serve every section of Providence including Providence Main, Providence Reserve, Providence Walk, and all newer phases. Whether you live near the clubhouse and golf course or in one of the quieter residential sections, our team knows the community well and can accommodate your cleaning needs throughout this beautiful master-planned neighborhood."
  },
  {
    question: "What size homes do you typically clean in Providence?",
    answer: "Providence homes typically range from 2,200 to 4,500+ square feet with 3-6 bedrooms. We're experienced with these executive-style homes and price our services accordingly. Whether you have a maintenance-free patio home or a sprawling estate overlooking the golf course, we can customize our service to fit your needs and budget."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes with golf course views and outdoor living spaces?",
    answer: "Many Providence homes feature stunning outdoor living areas - screened porches, covered patios, and outdoor kitchens. While we primarily focus on interior cleaning, we can clean patio furniture, outdoor surfaces, and ensure your indoor-outdoor transition spaces are pristine. We understand the importance of keeping those spaces guest-ready for entertaining."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean during work hours while we're at Cummings Research Park?",
    answer: "Absolutely! This is our most popular option for Providence professionals. Many residents work at nearby Cummings Research Park, Redstone Arsenal, or downtown Huntsville. You can provide us with a garage code, key, or smart lock access. We'll clean while you're at work and lock up securely when finished - come home to a spotless house."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer services for Providence community events and party cleanup?",
    answer: "Yes! Providence is known for its active community with clubhouse events, pool parties, and neighborhood gatherings. We offer pre-event cleaning to get your home guest-ready and post-event cleanup to handle the aftermath. Same-day service is available when you need help before or after hosting."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle the resort-style amenities and larger homes?",
    answer: "Providence homes often feature open floor plans with great rooms, chef's kitchens, home offices, and bonus spaces. Our teams are experienced with these luxury layouts - we clean efficiently while respecting your furniture arrangement and decor. High ceilings, multiple living areas, and premium finishes? We bring the right equipment and attention to detail."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your regular maintenance cleaning?",
    answer: "Our regular service (weekly or bi-weekly) includes all living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and tidying. We focus on keeping your Providence home consistently company-ready. You'll have the same team each visit who learns your home and preferences - no surprises, just reliable excellence."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your products safe for families with children and pets?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Providence families have children and pets. We use eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning products that are tough on dirt but gentle on your family. No harsh chemical residues - your kids and pets can safely play on freshly cleaned floors. We're also comfortable working around your pets during cleaning."
