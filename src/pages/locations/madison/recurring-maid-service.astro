  {
    question: "What recurring cleaning frequencies do you offer in Madison?",
    answer: "We offer weekly, biweekly (every two weeks), and monthly recurring cleaning in Madison. Weekly provides the deepest savings (20% off) and keeps your home consistently pristine—ideal for busy Town Madison and Clift Farm families. Biweekly is our most popular option for Madison professionals, balancing value and maintenance. Monthly works well for smaller homes or those who do light cleaning between visits."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save with recurring maid service in Madison?",
    answer: "Madison recurring clients save significantly: Weekly service saves 20%, biweekly saves 15%, and monthly saves 10% compared to one-time cleaning rates. For a typical Madison home (2,400-3,200 sq ft), that's $40-70+ savings per cleaning, adding up to $500-1,500+ annually depending on frequency."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve all Madison neighborhoods including Town Madison?",
    answer: "Yes! We provide recurring maid service throughout all of Madison including Town Madison (The Exchange, Heights, Commons, West End), Clift Farm, Rainbow Mountain Heights, Providence, Bradford Creek, Heritage Plantation, West Highlands, Madison City, Triana, Celtic Manor, Lake Forest, and all surrounding areas."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my cleaning frequency or schedule?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Madison clients adjust seasonally—more frequent during busy work periods at Redstone Arsenal or Research Park, less during slower times. Switch between weekly, biweekly, or monthly anytime with 48 hours notice. No penalties or fees for changing. We also accommodate schedule shifts for travel or special events."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I get the same cleaning team each visit?",
    answer: "Yes! We assign a dedicated team to your Madison home. The same trusted cleaners come every visit, learning your preferences, your home's layout, and any special requests. They'll know that you prefer the guest room prioritized, or that certain areas need extra attention. Consistency is key to our service quality."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in recurring maid service?",
    answer: "Every visit includes thorough dusting, vacuuming, mopping, kitchen cleaning (counters, stovetop, sink, appliance exteriors), bathroom sanitizing (toilet, shower, tub, sink, mirrors), bed making, trash removal, and high-touch surface disinfection. Deep cleaning tasks rotate through visits to ensure your entire Madison home stays fresh."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to sign a contract for recurring service?",
    answer: "Never. Our recurring service is completely contract-free. Pause, skip, or cancel anytime with 48 hours notice. We keep Madison clients through quality service, not legal obligations. Most families stay with us for years because they love the results and the consistency."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I start recurring maid service in Madison?",
    answer: "Call (256) 856-1006 or complete our online form. We'll discuss your Madison home's size, layout, and your needs, then recommend a frequency. Most clients begin with a deep cleaning to establish a baseline, then transition to their chosen recurring schedule. We can often start within the same week."

  <!-- Why Madison Families Choose Recurring -->

          Why Madison Families Choose <span class="gold-gradient">Recurring Service</span>
        </h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
          <p class="mb-6">
            Madison isn't just Alabama's fastest-growing city—it's home to some of the state's busiest professionals. With nearly 19% of residents working from home, careers at Redstone Arsenal and NASA Marshall, and families juggling James Clemens and Bob Jones school schedules, time is precious. The last thing you want to do on your weekend is deep clean a 3,000 square foot home.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            That's why so many Town Madison, Clift Farm, and Rainbow Mountain Heights families choose recurring maid service. Instead of spending 4-6 hours every Saturday scrubbing bathrooms and mopping floors, you come home to a spotless house—every week, every two weeks, or every month. Your time goes back to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            With median household incomes exceeding $131,000, Madison families understand the value of their time. Hiring professional cleaners isn't an expense—it's an investment in your quality of life, your family time, and your sanity. And with savings up to 20% on recurring service, it's more affordable than you might think.
