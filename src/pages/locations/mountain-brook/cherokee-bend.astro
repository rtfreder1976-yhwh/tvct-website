    question: "What makes Cherokee Bend estates different from other neighborhoods?",
    answer: "Cherokee Bend represents Mountain Brook's most exclusive enclave. Properties typically range from $800,000 to $3 million+, featuring custom estates on large lots (often 1+ acres), many with Shades Creek frontage, mature landscaping, formal gardens, swimming pools, and guest houses. These aren't standard homes - they're architectural statements requiring specialized care."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle privacy and discretion for high-profile clients?",
    answer: "Privacy is paramount for Cherokee Bend residents. Our teams arrive in unmarked vehicles if requested, maintain strict confidentiality about client identities and home details, sign NDAs when needed, and work with estate managers, personal assistants, and household staff seamlessly. We understand that discretion isn't optional - it's essential."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you coordinate with existing household staff?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many Cherokee Bend estates have existing household staff, estate managers, or personal assistants. We're experienced working within established household operations, coordinating schedules, respecting staff hierarchies, and providing detailed communication to whoever manages the property. We integrate smoothly into your existing team."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in estate cleaning versus regular cleaning?",
    answer: "Estate cleaning goes far beyond standard residential service. We clean larger square footage (5,000-15,000+ sq ft), handle multiple living levels and guest accommodations, maintain formal entertaining spaces, care for high-end finishes like imported marble and custom millwork, clean pool houses and outdoor kitchens, and provide white-glove attention to architectural details that define luxury properties."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you protect valuable furnishings, art, and antiques?",
    answer: "Our teams receive specialized training in handling valuable items. We use pH-balanced products safe for fine finishes, employ proper techniques for antique wood, crystal, and silver, document pre-existing conditions, use lint-free cloths on delicate surfaces, and never move valuable art or collectibles without explicit permission. Your treasures are treated as irreplaceable."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer service for special events and entertaining?",
    answer: "Yes. Cherokee Bend residents frequently host corporate events, fundraisers, and social gatherings. We provide pre-event deep cleaning, day-of setup coordination, post-event cleanup, and regular maintenance to keep your home perpetually guest-ready. Whether it's a seated dinner for 20 or a garden party for 200, we ensure your estate shines."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle large properties with multiple structures?",
    answer: "Definitely. Many Cherokee Bend estates include main residences, guest houses, pool houses, home offices, and outdoor entertaining pavilions. We clean all structures on your property, maintain consistency across buildings, coordinate timing to avoid disruption, and ensure every space reflects the same standard of excellence."
  },
  {
    question: "What insurance coverage do you carry for high-value homes?",
    answer: "We carry $2 million in general liability insurance specifically because we serve high-value estates. All team members are bonded, background-checked, and insured. We also carry workers' compensation to protect you from liability. We're happy to provide certificates of insurance to your estate manager or insurance advisor."
