    question: "What makes Tudor homes in English Village unique for cleaning?",
    answer: "English Village features distinctive Tudor Revival and English cottage architecture from the 1920s-1950s. These charming homes have unique elements - leaded glass windows, dark wood trim, arched doorways, exposed beams, and original hardwood floors. Cleaning Tudor architecture requires understanding how to care for aged wood, preserve leaded glass, and protect architectural details that give these homes their character."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you protect leaded glass windows and vintage details?",
    answer: "Leaded glass windows are treasures that require gentle care. We use appropriate cleaners that won't damage lead cames or weaken old putty, clean with soft cloths to avoid scratching, and never use harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. The same careful approach applies to all vintage details - original tile, period hardware, and architectural elements that make English Village homes special."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle homes with both historic charm and modern updates?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many English Village homes blend period character with modern conveniences - original hardwoods alongside renovated kitchens, vintage tile with new appliances, Tudor exteriors with updated interiors. We understand how to care for both the historic features you cherish and the modern finishes you've invested in. Best of both requires specialized knowledge."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you understand care for dark wood trim and paneling?",
    answer: "Yes. Tudor homes feature dark-stained wood trim, wainscoting, and sometimes full paneling. We use appropriate products that clean without damaging the finish, enhance rather than dull the wood, and respect the aged patina that gives these homes character. We never use products that leave residue or damage vintage finishes."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in regular cleaning for English Village homes?",
    answer: "Our regular service (weekly or bi-weekly) covers all living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, dusting of wood trim and built-ins, careful cleaning of vintage details, vacuuming and appropriate care for original hardwood floors, and general tidying. Same team every visit means they learn your home's character and your preferences."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle original hardwood floors?",
    answer: "Many English Village homes have beautiful original hardwood from the 1920s-1950s. We use pH-neutral cleaners appropriate for aged wood, avoid excessive water that can damage vintage floors, employ techniques that preserve the finish rather than wear it down, and respect that these floors are irreplaceable treasures, not just surfaces to clean."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean compact Tudor cottages efficiently?",
    answer: "Definitely. English Village has many charming compact Tudor cottages - smaller square footage but packed with character. We're experienced with efficient cleaning in cozy spaces, navigating tighter floor plans and smaller rooms, and ensuring every corner of your cottage shines. Small doesn't mean less thorough - it means more attention per square foot."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve the English Village shopping area and nearby homes?",
    answer: "Yes! We serve all English Village - from homes directly adjacent to the shopping district on Montevallo Road to Tudor residences on surrounding streets. We're familiar with parking in this area, coordinate arrival times, and work efficiently to minimize disruption in this walkable, community-oriented neighborhood."

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            English Village stands as one of Mountain Brook's most distinctive neighborhoods - a charming enclave of Tudor Revival and English cottage architecture centered around the upscale English Village shopping district on Montevallo Road. Built primarily in the 1920s through 1950s, these homes exude character, craftsmanship, and Old World charm rarely found in modern construction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Properties in English Village range from $400,000 to $1.5 million, featuring Tudor half-timbering, steep gabled roofs, leaded glass windows, arched doorways, dark wood trim and wainscoting, exposed ceiling beams, original hardwood floors, and vintage tile bathrooms. Many homes have been thoughtfully updated - modern kitchens and baths while preserving the architectural details that make them special.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The neighborhood attracts homeowners who appreciate quality, character, and craftsmanship - young professionals who love the walkable lifestyle, families drawn to the community feel, and empty nesters downsizing from larger estates but unwilling to sacrifice charm. These are people who chose English Village specifically for its character, not despite it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Your Tudor home isn't just another house - it's a piece of history, a work of craftsmanship, and likely your pride and joy. Standard cleaning companies don't understand leaded glass care, vintage wood preservation, or how to protect aged architectural details. We do. Every team member is trained in caring for period homes, because your English Village Tudor deserves specialized expertise, not generic service.
