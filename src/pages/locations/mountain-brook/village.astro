    question: "What makes Mountain Brook Village unique for cleaning services?",
    answer: "Mountain Brook Village represents the walkable heart of Mountain Brook - a rare Southern lifestyle where residents can stroll to upscale boutiques, fine dining, and services. Homes range from $500,000 to $2 million+, mixing character properties with modern renovations. Many are updated cottages, European-inspired residences, and architect-designed homes. The Village lifestyle means homeowners value their time and prefer professionals who understand quality."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you accommodate young professionals with busy schedules?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Mountain Brook Village attracts successful young professionals and dual-income couples who work demanding jobs. We clean while you're at the office, provide key or smart lock access, and lock up securely when finished. Many clients schedule bi-weekly or weekly service so they can actually enjoy their evenings and weekends instead of cleaning."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean renovated historic homes and cottages?",
    answer: "Yes! The Village has many beautifully renovated properties - updated 1930s-1950s homes with modern kitchens, renovated baths, and preserved character details. We understand how to care for both the historic charm (original hardwoods, vintage tile, built-ins) and modern finishes (quartz counters, new appliances, contemporary fixtures). Best of both worlds requires specialized knowledge."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes close to the Village shopping area?",
    answer: "Many Village homes are within walking distance of shops and restaurants - that's the appeal! We're experienced with tighter parking situations, coordinate arrival times to avoid disruption, and maintain quiet, professional operations that respect your neighbors. We understand urban-adjacent living requires consideration."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in regular maintenance for Village homes?",
    answer: "Our regular service (weekly or bi-weekly) covers all living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and general tidying. We focus on keeping your home company-ready for the entertaining lifestyle the Village encourages. Same team every visit means consistency and efficiency - they know your preferences and your home's quirks."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with pre-party cleaning and post-event cleanup?",
    answer: "Definitely! Village residents love to entertain - dinner parties, book clubs, holiday gatherings. We provide pre-event deep cleaning to ensure your home sparkles, and post-event cleanup to restore order. Living in the Village means spontaneous entertaining - we help make it effortless rather than stressful."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with empty nesters downsizing to the Village?",
    answer: "Yes, many empty nesters move to the Village for walkability, convenience, and community. Whether you're downsizing from a larger estate or renovating a Village cottage, we provide move-in cleaning, regular maintenance, and the reliability that makes smaller-home living truly liberating. Less house, more life - we handle the cleaning."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you protect hardwood floors and original details?",
    answer: "Many Village homes have beautiful original hardwood floors, vintage tile in bathrooms, and architectural details worth preserving. We use appropriate products for aged wood, gentle cleaners for vintage materials, and techniques that protect rather than damage character features. Your home's charm is preserved with every visit."

            Mountain Brook Village isn't just a neighborhood - it's a lifestyle. This is Mountain Brook's walkable heart, where residents can stroll to upscale boutiques like Gus Mayer and Soca, grab coffee at O'Henry's, enjoy fine dining at Chez Fonfon or Vecchia, and walk home carrying their shopping bags. It's a rare Southern community designed for pedestrians, not just cars.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Homes in the Village range from $500,000 to over $2 million, mixing updated cottages from the 1930s-1950s with architect-designed modern residences. Many feature renovated kitchens with high-end appliances, preserved hardwood floors, European-inspired design elements, and outdoor living spaces perfect for entertaining. These properties attract successful young professionals, empty nesters seeking walkability, and families who value community.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The Village lifestyle means you're busy - working demanding jobs, enjoying restaurants and events, entertaining friends, participating in community activities. You didn't move here to spend weekends scrubbing bathrooms. You moved here for quality of life, convenience, and the ability to walk to everything you need.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            That's where we come in. Whether you need weekly maintenance to stay ahead of busy life, or deep cleaning before hosting a dinner party, The Valley Clean Team understands Village homeowners. You value your time, expect quality, and appreciate professionals who just get it done right. We deliver exactly that - every single time.
