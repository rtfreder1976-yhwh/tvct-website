  {
    question: "What areas of Big Cove do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of the Big Cove community including homes along Big Cove Road, properties near Monte Sano State Park's eastern boundary, the Dug Hill Road area, and rural acreage throughout southeast Madison County. Whether you're in a neighborhood subdivision or on a private multi-acre estate, we bring the same premium service to every Big Cove residence."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes on larger properties with acreage?",
    answer: "Many Big Cove homes sit on 2-10+ acres of land. While we focus on interior cleaning, we understand that rural properties have unique considerations - mudrooms that get heavy use, multiple entry points, and the dust that comes with country living. We're experienced cleaning larger homes on rural properties and can accommodate the extra time these estates require."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around our horses, livestock, or farm operations?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Big Cove is known for its equestrian properties and hobby farms. We're comfortable working on properties with horses, chickens, goats, and other animals. We'll focus on your home while respecting your land and livestock. Just let us know about any special considerations regarding your property."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve homes with workshops, barns converted to living space, or guest houses?",
    answer: "Yes! Many Big Cove properties include additional structures - barn apartments, converted workshops, mother-in-law suites, or guest houses. We can include these spaces in your service. We'll discuss all the structures you want cleaned during your initial consultation and quote accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle travel to rural Big Cove properties?",
    answer: "Big Cove's rural location is part of its charm. Our teams regularly serve properties throughout the area and are comfortable navigating country roads and private lanes. Travel time to your property is factored into our scheduling to ensure your cleaning team arrives on time and has adequate time to thoroughly clean your home."
  },
  {
    question: "What about homes with well water or septic systems?",
    answer: "Many Big Cove homes use well water and septic systems. We're mindful of these systems when cleaning - using appropriate water quantities and septic-safe products. We understand rural infrastructure and clean accordingly. Your home gets pristine without concerns about system strain."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you accommodate homes with security systems, gates, or long driveways?",
    answer: "Certainly! Rural properties often have gates, security systems, and lengthy driveways. We'll work out access arrangements that suit your security preferences - gate codes, key boxes, or coordination with your arrival. We respect your privacy and property security while ensuring reliable service."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer services for vacation properties or second homes in Big Cove?",
    answer: "Yes! Some Big Cove properties serve as weekend retreats or vacation homes. We offer pre-arrival cleaning so your country escape is ready when you arrive, and departure cleaning to leave it pristine. We can coordinate with property caretakers and provide condition reports if needed."

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Big Cove represents Huntsville's premier rural residential community - a vast area of rolling hills, pastureland, and wooded estates east of the city and south of Hampton Cove. Here, successful professionals and families have found the perfect balance: country privacy with suburban accessibility. Properties range from $300,000 to well over $700,000, with many estates on significant acreage.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This is horse country. Equestrian properties dot the landscape with pastures, barns, and riding arenas. Hobby farms raise everything from chickens to cattle. Garden enthusiasts cultivate extensive landscapes. And families simply enjoy the space that only rural living provides - room for children to roam, room for workshops and hobbies, room to breathe.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Big Cove homes reflect their rural setting. Custom builds often exceed 3,000 square feet with features suited for country life: large mudrooms, spacious garages, wraparound porches, and living spaces oriented toward pastoral views. Many properties include guest houses, workshops, or converted barn spaces. The quality of construction matches the quality of the lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Country living brings unique cleaning challenges. Dirt roads mean dust. Acreage means multiple entry points tracking in nature. Animals mean extra attention to certain areas. The Valley Clean Team understands Big Cove's specific needs and brings service tailored for rural estate living. Your country home deserves the same premium care as any Huntsville luxury property.
