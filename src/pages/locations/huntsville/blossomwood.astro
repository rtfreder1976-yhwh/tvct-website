    question: "What areas of Blossomwood do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of Blossomwood and the surrounding historic neighborhoods near downtown Huntsville, including Blossomwood proper, the areas around Blossomwood Elementary, Locust Street corridor, Whitesburg Drive vicinity, and the connected historic neighborhoods south of downtown. From cottages to larger family homes, we bring premium service throughout this beloved community."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you care for historic and mid-century homes?",
    answer: "Blossomwood homes span from the 1920s through 1960s, featuring solid construction, original hardwood floors, plaster walls, built-in features, and craftsmanship rarely found in newer builds. We use appropriate products for vintage surfaces - gentle care for original hardwood, proper techniques for plaster, and respect for architectural details. Your home's character is preserved while becoming spotless."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle smaller cottage-style homes as well as larger properties?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Blossomwood features everything from charming 1,200 square foot cottages to spacious 3,000+ square foot family homes. We customize our service to your home's size and needs. Smaller homes receive the same attention to detail as larger properties - often they require even more careful attention to maximize every square foot."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work around original features like built-in bookshelves and china cabinets?",
    answer: "Yes! We love Blossomwood's architectural character - built-in bookcases, original china cabinets, window seats, and millwork details. We carefully dust and clean around these features, treating them with the respect they deserve. These elements make your home special, and we enhance them rather than ignore them."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle older kitchens and bathrooms?",
    answer: "Blossomwood kitchens range from beautifully preserved vintage style to completely renovated modern spaces. Same with bathrooms - some retain charming original tile, others are fully updated. We adapt our approach to what you have, using appropriate products and techniques for both vintage and contemporary surfaces."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around our home-based business or work-from-home schedule?",
    answer: "Many Blossomwood residents work from home or run small businesses from their properties. We can absolutely work around your schedule - clean during specific hours, avoid your office space during calls, or focus on certain rooms while you work in others. We're flexible and understand the work-from-home lifestyle."
  },
  {
    question: "What about homes with established gardens and lots of plants inside?",
    answer: "Blossomwood is known for its beautiful landscaping and many homeowners bring that love of plants indoors. We're careful around houseplants, won't damage delicate arrangements, and can clean around even elaborate indoor gardens. Your green thumb's efforts remain intact while everything else gets pristine."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve the rental properties and Airbnbs in the Blossomwood area?",
    answer: "Yes! Blossomwood's walkability to downtown makes it popular for short-term rentals. We provide turnover cleaning for Airbnb hosts and property owners, as well as regular maintenance for rental properties. Quick turnarounds, attention to guest-ready details, and reliable scheduling keep your rental performing well."

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Blossomwood stands as one of Huntsville's most cherished intown neighborhoods. Developed from the 1920s through the 1960s, this community south of downtown offers what modern subdivisions simply cannot replicate: mature trees creating canopy-covered streets, architectural variety that tells the story of each era, and the walkable lifestyle that today's homebuyers increasingly seek.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Home values in Blossomwood range from $275,000 for charming cottages to $600,000+ for larger, renovated properties. The neighborhood attracts professionals who work downtown, young families who value walkability to Blossomwood Elementary, and those who appreciate historic architecture over cookie-cutter construction. It's a community where neighbors know each other and homes have stories.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            These homes feature the solid construction of their eras - original hardwood floors that have weathered decades, plaster walls with character, built-in bookcases and china cabinets, substantial woodwork and millwork. Some owners preserve these vintage features; others have tastefully updated while honoring the home's heritage. Either approach creates homes that demand more than ordinary cleaning.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            The Valley Clean Team appreciates what makes Blossomwood special. We understand that your home's character features deserve careful attention, not just a quick once-over. Whether your cottage retains its 1940s charm or showcases a modern kitchen alongside original built-ins, we bring the expertise historic homes require.
