    question: "What areas around Cummings Research Park do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all residential areas surrounding Cummings Research Park including neighborhoods along Old Madison Pike, Research Park Boulevard corridor, the Bradford Creek area, Explorer Boulevard vicinity, Wynn Drive neighborhoods, and the residential communities between Research Park and Madison. We also serve South Huntsville professionals commuting to CRP. If you work in Research Park, we likely serve where you live."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean while I'm at work in Research Park?",
    answer: "Absolutely - this is our most popular arrangement for CRP professionals! Provide us with a key, garage code, or smart lock access and we'll clean while you're at work. Imagine leaving your office on Explorer Boulevard and coming home to a spotless house. No weekends spent cleaning, no rushing to beat traffic to meet a cleaner. Your home is ready when you are."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you understand the schedules of defense contractors and aerospace engineers?",
    answer: "We do! Many CRP professionals have demanding schedules - some work standard hours, others have flex schedules or work from home certain days. Security clearance holders may have unpredictable schedule changes. We offer flexible scheduling that adapts to your work life. Need to shift your cleaning day occasionally? We accommodate professional schedules."
  },
  {
    question: "What about homes with home offices or SCIF-adjacent work setups?",
    answer: "Many Research Park professionals maintain dedicated home offices for remote work or after-hours projects. We respect these spaces completely - we'll clean around your work setup without disturbing papers, equipment, or sensitive materials. Let us know which areas require extra care and we'll follow your preferences precisely."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve the newer subdivisions being built near Research Park?",
    answer: "Yes! The areas around CRP continue to grow with new subdivisions offering convenient commutes. We provide move-in cleaning for newly constructed homes and regular maintenance for new residents. Whether you're in an established neighborhood or a recent development, we serve the entire Research Park corridor."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle dual-income households with complex schedules?",
    answer: "Research Park attracts many dual-income professional couples - both partners may work demanding jobs with varying schedules. We work with whatever access method suits you best and can coordinate around both schedules. No need to be home for cleaning; we'll secure your home when finished and you'll return to cleanliness."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your regular cleaning service?",
    answer: "Our regular service covers all bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living areas, and home office spaces. We dust, vacuum, mop, and thoroughly clean surfaces throughout. Kitchens receive detailed attention including counters and appliances. Bathrooms are scrubbed and sanitized. For recurring clients, the same trusted team maintains consistent quality every visit."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with cleaning before or after hosting business colleagues?",
    answer: "Definitely! Research Park professionals often host colleagues, visiting contractors, or business dinners at home. We offer same-day service when available for pre-event cleaning and post-event cleanup. Make a professional impression with a home that reflects your standards - we'll have everything spotless for your guests."

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Cummings Research Park is the fourth-largest research park in the United States and the second-largest in the nation. With over 300 companies employing more than 26,000 people, it's the economic engine of North Alabama. Aerospace giants like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman operate alongside NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and Redstone Arsenal. This concentration of talent has created neighborhoods filled with engineers, scientists, program managers, and defense contractors.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The professionals who power Huntsville's aerospace and defense industry work demanding jobs. Long hours, travel requirements, and the mental intensity of complex technical work leave little energy for housework. Dual-income households where both partners work in demanding fields face an even greater time crunch. Weekends should be for recovery, family time, and actually enjoying the quality of life that Huntsville offers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Homes in the neighborhoods surrounding Research Park reflect the success of their owners. Properties typically range from $300,000 to $600,000, with executive homes exceeding that. These are well-maintained residences in established neighborhoods and newer subdivisions, featuring 3-5 bedrooms, home offices, and the space professionals need. Many include dedicated work-from-home setups that have become essential in the hybrid work era.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            The Valley Clean Team understands what Research Park professionals need: reliable service that happens while you're at work, a trustworthy team you can give access to your home, and consistent quality that lets you stop thinking about cleaning entirely. We handle your home so you can focus on the work that matters.
