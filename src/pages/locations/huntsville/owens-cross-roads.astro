    question: "What areas of Owens Cross Roads do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of Owens Cross Roads including the Highway 431 corridor, homes near the New Market area, properties along Old Highway 431, established neighborhoods and newer subdivisions throughout the community, and rural properties in surrounding Madison County. From family homes to executive properties, we bring premium service to all of Owens Cross Roads."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle the mix of new construction and established homes in Owens Cross Roads?",
    answer: "Owens Cross Roads features everything from brand-new construction in growing subdivisions to established homes that have been part of the community for decades. We adapt our cleaning approach to each home's specific needs - proper care for new finishes like quartz and LVP, and appropriate attention to traditional materials in older homes. Every property gets customized service."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around our commute schedule to Huntsville?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Owens Cross Roads residents commute to Research Park or downtown Huntsville. We offer daytime cleaning while you're at work - provide us with a key, garage code, or smart lock access. Come home from your commute to a spotless house. Your evenings and weekends are yours, not spent catching up on housework."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve the newer subdivisions being built in Owens Cross Roads?",
    answer: "Yes! Owens Cross Roads is growing rapidly with new subdivisions and custom builds. We provide move-in cleaning for newly constructed homes, regular maintenance for new residents, and understand the modern finishes and open floor plans common in today's new construction. We grow with the community."
  },
  {
    question: "What about properties with land and outbuildings?",
    answer: "Many Owens Cross Roads properties include acreage, workshops, or additional structures. While we focus on residential cleaning, we can discuss including finished living spaces in guest houses or converted outbuildings. We understand rural property layouts and accommodate the unique features of country homes."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes with pets - especially larger dogs common in country settings?",
    answer: "Owens Cross Roads families often have dogs, and we're completely comfortable working around them. We use pet-safe products, can work with pets present, and focus extra attention on pet hair and the entry areas where outdoor dogs track in dirt. Your furry family members are welcome during our visit."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your regular cleaning service?",
    answer: "Our regular cleaning covers all bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, and living areas. We dust, vacuum, mop, and thoroughly clean all surfaces. Kitchens receive detailed attention to counters and appliances, bathrooms are scrubbed and sanitized. For recurring clients, the same team maintains consistent quality week after week."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help when we're selling our home?",
    answer: "Definitely! A clean home shows better and sells faster. We offer move-out and showing preparation services. Deep clean before listing, regular maintenance during the selling period, and final move-out cleaning are all available. We help Owens Cross Roads sellers make the best impression on buyers."

            Owens Cross Roads represents the sweet spot of Madison County living - more space than you'd find closer to Huntsville, excellent value for your investment, and a manageable commute to Research Park and downtown. This unincorporated community along Highway 431 has transformed from a rural crossroads into a thriving residential area where families put down roots.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The community offers genuine variety. New subdivisions with contemporary homes sit alongside established neighborhoods and rural properties with acreage. Home values typically range from $250,000 to $500,000, with larger custom properties commanding higher prices. Whether you bought new construction last year or have been in your family home for decades, Owens Cross Roads offers the space and community feel that families seek.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            New Market Road Elementary, Hampton Cove Elementary, and Hampton Cove Middle School serve many OCR families, and the community takes pride in its schools. Youth sports keep parents busy on evenings and weekends. Many residents commute to Redstone Arsenal, Research Park, or Huntsville Hospital for work, making convenience and time-saving services especially valuable.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Your family's time together matters more than housework. Between commutes, school events, sports practices, and trying to maintain some semblance of personal time, who has energy left for cleaning? The Valley Clean Team gives Owens Cross Roads families their weekends back. Come home to a clean house instead of chores waiting for attention.
