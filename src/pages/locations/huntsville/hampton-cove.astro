    question: "What makes Hampton Cove homes different from other areas?",
    answer: "Hampton Cove properties typically range from 2,500 to 5,000+ square feet with open floor plans designed for family living and entertaining. Many homes feature golf course views, outdoor living spaces, vaulted ceilings, and premium finishes. The community attracts successful professionals who want their homes to reflect their lifestyle - pristine, welcoming, and always guest-ready."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle homes with golf course frontage and large outdoor spaces?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Hampton Cove homes have extensive outdoor living areas - covered patios, screened porches, and outdoor kitchens. While we primarily focus on interior cleaning, we can clean patio furniture, outdoor surfaces, and ensure your indoor-outdoor living spaces are pristine. We understand the importance of your view and outdoor entertaining areas."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer service during the week while we're at work?",
    answer: "Yes, this is our most popular option for Hampton Cove's dual-income professionals. You can provide us with a key, garage code, or smart lock access. We'll clean while you're at work and lock up securely when finished. Many clients love coming home to a spotless house after a long day - it's like a mini-vacation."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in regular maintenance cleaning?",
    answer: "Our regular service (weekly or bi-weekly) includes all living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and tidying. We focus on the high-traffic areas that busy families need maintained. You'll have the same team each visit who learns your home and preferences. It's consistent, reliable service that keeps your Hampton Cove home company-ready."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with move-in or move-out cleaning?",
    answer: "Yes! Hampton Cove has an active real estate market, and we do many move cleans. Move-out cleaning ensures you get your deposit back or leave the home pristine for buyers. Move-in cleaning gives you a fresh start in your new Hampton Cove home. We include appliances, cabinets, closets - everything for a complete reset."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle open floor plans?",
    answer: "Hampton Cove homes often feature open-concept living with great rooms combining kitchen, dining, and living spaces. Our teams are experienced with these layouts - we clean in a way that maintains your furniture arrangement and decor while ensuring every surface in the open space shines. High ceilings and ceiling fans? We've got tall ladders."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need post-construction cleaning after a renovation?",
    answer: "We do extensive post-construction work in Hampton Cove. Whether it's a kitchen remodel, bathroom addition, or finished basement, we'll remove all construction dust, clean windows, detail surfaces, and make your renovated space move-in ready. We know how to handle the fine dust that gets everywhere after contractor work."
  },
  {
    question: "Are you comfortable working around children and pets?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Hampton Cove families have children and pets. We're comfortable working around both and use family-safe, pet-friendly products. If you prefer us to avoid certain rooms while pets are present, just let us know. We're flexible and understand family dynamics - our goal is to make your life easier, not disrupt it."
