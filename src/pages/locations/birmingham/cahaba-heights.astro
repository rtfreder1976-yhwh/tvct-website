Whether you're in the established sections or newer developments, we provide comprehensive cleaning services throughout this desirable unincorporated community.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you handle homes with river views and outdoor living spaces?",
    answer:
      "Cahaba Heights homes often feature beautiful outdoor living areas, screened porches, and spaces that blend indoor and outdoor living. We clean interior spaces thoroughly while paying special attention to transition areas like sunrooms, three-season rooms, and enclosed porches. We also ensure glass doors and windows are spotless so you can enjoy those gorgeous Cahaba River and mountain views.",
  },
  {
    question: "What size homes do you typically clean in Cahaba Heights?",
    answer:
      "We clean homes of all sizes in Cahaba Heights, from 2,500 sq ft family homes to 5,000+ sq ft custom estates. Many properties in this area feature multiple living levels, home offices, bonus rooms, and finished basements. We customize our approach based on your home's specific layout and your priorities.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around my family's schedule?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Cahaba Heights is home to many busy professionals and families with children. We offer flexible scheduling including while you're at work, after school drop-off, or on specific days that work for your routine. Many clients give us a key or garage code for secure access while they're away.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes with pets?",
    answer:
      "We love pets and many Cahaba Heights families have dogs, cats, or both. Just let us know about your pets and any specific concerns. We use pet-safe cleaning products, can work around pet areas, and are experienced with curious cats and friendly dogs. We'll always ensure doors stay secured to keep your pets safe.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What's the difference between regular cleaning and deep cleaning?",
    answer:
      "Regular cleaning maintains your home's cleanliness with consistent weekly or bi-weekly visits covering all standard areas. Deep cleaning is more intensive - we clean inside appliances, detail baseboards, wash interior windows, clean light fixtures, and address areas that accumulate grime over time. Most Cahaba Heights clients start with a deep clean, then maintain with regular service.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Are your cleaning products safe for hardwood floors and natural stone?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we use pH-balanced, high-quality products that are safe for hardwood floors, marble, granite, and other natural surfaces common in Cahaba Heights homes. We understand these are significant investments and use appropriate products and techniques for each surface type. If you have specific product preferences, we're happy to accommodate.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you cover beyond Cahaba Heights?",
    answer:
      "We serve all of greater Birmingham including Mountain Brook, Vestavia Hills, Homewood, Hoover, and downtown Birmingham. Many of our clients have recommended us to friends and family in neighboring communities. We're fully insured and our team is trained to the same high standards regardless of which neighborhood we're serving.",

            Cahaba Heights is one of Birmingham's most desirable communities -
            an unincorporated gem nestled between Mountain Brook and the scenic
            Cahaba River. This established neighborhood attracts professionals,
            families, and those who appreciate quality living without the
            formality of a gated community. Homes here range from charming
            mid-century builds to spacious custom estates, typically between
            2,500 and 5,000+ square feet.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            What makes Cahaba Heights special is the sense of community combined
            with natural beauty. Many homes feature stunning views of the
            surrounding mountains, mature tree canopies, and proximity to the
            Cahaba River - Alabama's longest free-flowing river and a treasured
            natural resource. Outdoor living spaces, screened porches, and homes
            designed to embrace the landscape are common throughout the
            neighborhood.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The residents of Cahaba Heights are discerning - they chose this
            community for its character, convenience, and quality of life. They
            expect service providers who understand their homes and respect
            their time. That's exactly what we deliver: professional, thorough
            cleaning from a team that treats your home like our own.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">

            Elementary or a sprawling property with river views, we customize
            our service to your home's unique needs and your family's
