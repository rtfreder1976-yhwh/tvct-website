    question:
      "What makes Homewood different from other Birmingham neighborhoods?",
    answer:
      "Homewood offers a unique blend of walkable urban village charm and established residential living. With a thriving downtown along 18th Street featuring local boutiques, restaurants, and cafes, plus neighborhoods ranging from 1920s Craftsman bungalows to modern new construction, Homewood attracts families, young professionals, and empty nesters who value community, convenience, and character. Homes typically range from 1,800 to 4,000 square feet.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do you clean both historic and newer construction homes in Homewood?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Homewood has a wonderful mix of architecture - charming 1920s-1940s bungalows and Craftsman homes alongside newer construction and renovated properties. Our teams are trained to handle vintage hardwood floors and original details in older homes, as well as modern finishes in contemporary builds. We adapt our techniques and products to what your specific home needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes near the walkable downtown area?",
    answer:
      "Properties near Homewood's downtown core on 18th Street often have unique parking situations and may be closer to neighbors. We coordinate arrival times, use appropriate parking, work efficiently to minimize any disruption, and ensure we leave your home pristine whether you live in a cottage near the shops or an estate in Edgewood.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What's included in your regular cleaning service for Homewood homes?",
    answer:
      "Our regular cleaning (weekly or bi-weekly) covers all living areas, bedrooms, and bathrooms thoroughly. We clean your kitchen completely including appliances and counters, dust all surfaces and furniture, vacuum and mop floors appropriate to their type, and handle baseboards and light fixtures. You get the same dedicated team each visit who learns your home's specific needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer services for families with children and pets?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Homewood is incredibly family-friendly and we serve many households with children and pets. We use eco-friendly, non-toxic products safe for kids and animals. We're experienced working around toys, pet bowls, and the real-life messes that come with busy family homes. We can also coordinate cleaning around nap schedules or school pickups.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean while I'm at work?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Many Homewood residents work in downtown Birmingham or the medical district and prefer we clean while they're at the office. Simply provide a key or smart lock code - we'll arrive on schedule, clean your home thoroughly, lock up securely, and you'll come home to a sparkling house. It's like magic, but it's just reliable service.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas of Homewood do you serve?",
    answer:
      "We serve all Homewood neighborhoods including Edgewood, Rosedale, Hollywood, Oxmoor, Oak Grove, West Homewood, and Central Homewood near 18th Street. Whether you're in a cottage near the shops or a larger home in the hills, we've got you covered. We also serve nearby Mountain Brook, Vestavia Hills, and all of Birmingham.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can you start service?",
    answer:
      "We typically schedule new Homewood clients within 3-5 business days for regular service. Need something sooner? We offer same-day and next-day deep cleaning when available. Call us at 256-826-1100 and we'll find a time that works for your schedule.",

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Homewood is one of Birmingham's most beloved communities - a perfect
            blend of walkable downtown charm and established residential
            neighborhoods. The vibrant 18th Street corridor features
            locally-owned boutiques, beloved restaurants, and community
            gathering spots, while surrounding streets are lined with homes
            ranging from charming 1920s bungalows to spacious modern builds.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Homes in Homewood typically range from 1,800 to 4,000 square feet,
            with property values from $250,000 to $800,000+. You'll find
            Craftsman bungalows with original hardwood floors, Tudor cottages
            with character details, mid-century ranches, and newer construction
            - often on the same street. This architectural diversity makes
            Homewood special, and it requires cleaning teams who understand how
            to care for different home types.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Homewood attracts families drawn to excellent schools, young
            professionals who love the walkable lifestyle, and empty nesters who
            appreciate the convenience and community. Many residents work in
            downtown Birmingham, the medical district, or nearby Mountain Brook
            - busy people who want to spend their limited free time enjoying
            this wonderful community, not cleaning their homes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Whether you live in a cozy cottage near Patriot Park or a larger
            family home in Edgewood, your home deserves care that respects its
            character and your busy schedule. We provide reliable, thorough
            cleaning that lets you love your Homewood lifestyle without the
            weekend chore list.
