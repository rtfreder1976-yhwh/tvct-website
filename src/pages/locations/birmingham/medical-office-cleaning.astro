  localContext={[
    "Birmingham's thriving healthcare sector, anchored by UAB Hospital and the Birmingham Medical District, represents one of Alabama's largest concentrations of medical practices. From specialty clinics along Highway 280 to dental offices in Homewood and urgent care centers throughout Hoover, Jefferson County healthcare providers serve millions of patient visits annually.",
    "Medical office cleaning in Birmingham requires understanding the unique challenges of Alabama's humid climate, which can accelerate bacterial growth and create challenges for infection control. Our cleaning protocols account for these regional factors, using EPA-registered hospital-grade disinfectants effective against MRSA, C. diff, and other healthcare-associated pathogens.",
    "Whether you operate a busy dermatology practice in Vestavia Hills, a pediatric dental office in Homewood, or a multi-physician urgent care in Hoover, The Valley Clean Team delivers the clinical-grade sanitation your patients expect and regulatory compliance demands. We understand that in healthcare, cleanliness isn't just about appearance—it's about patient safety and practice reputation."
