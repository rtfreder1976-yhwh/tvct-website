            Liberty Park is more than a recreational facility - it's the heart of Vestavia Hills family life. With 120+ acres featuring aquatic centers, athletic fields, walking trails, tennis courts, and community gathering spaces, Liberty Park represents the active lifestyle that defines this area. Families here prioritize health, recreation, and community engagement.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The neighborhoods surrounding Liberty Park reflect these values. Homes typically range from 2,500 to 4,500 square feet, built in the 1990s through today, featuring open floor plans perfect for family living. Many properties have finished basements (great for teen hangouts and playrooms), multi-car garages (essential for all that sports equipment), and outdoor spaces for backyard gatherings.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Liberty Park area residents are professionals, business owners, UAB physicians, and corporate leaders who value Vestavia Hills schools and the community-oriented lifestyle. They're busy managing careers, coordinating sports schedules, shuttling to swim meets, attending school events, and actually using that park membership they invested in.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            When life is this full, cleaning shouldn't be one more thing on your to-do list. We provide consistent, thorough service that lets you focus on what matters - being present for your family's active life while maintaining a home that's actually clean when you walk through the door.
