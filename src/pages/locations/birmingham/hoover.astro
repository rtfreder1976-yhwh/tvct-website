            Hoover is Alabama's largest suburb and one of the fastest-growing cities in the Southeast. With a population of over 90,000 residents, excellent schools in the Hoover City School District, and proximity to the Riverchase Galleria - Alabama's largest shopping destination - Hoover attracts successful families and professionals who demand quality in every aspect of their lives.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Home values in Hoover range from $250,000 to over $1.5 million, with prestigious master-planned communities like Ross Bridge (featuring the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail course), Greystone (with its own championship golf course), Riverchase, and the lakefront homes of Lake Cyrus. These communities feature homes typically ranging from 2,000 to 6,000+ square feet with modern amenities, open floor plans, and premium finishes.
          </p>
