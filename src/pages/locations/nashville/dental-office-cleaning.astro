      question: "What types of dental practices do you clean in Nashville?",
      answer: "We clean all types of dental practices including general dentistry, cosmetic dentistry, orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, oral surgery, and pediatric dentistry. From single-dentist practices in Green Hills to multi-location dental groups across Nashville, we understand the unique cleaning needs of dental environments."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you clean dental operatories?",
      answer: "We use EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectants on all operatory surfaces including dental chairs, counter surfaces, cabinetry exteriors, light handles, and equipment surfaces. We follow CDC guidelines for environmental surface cleaning in dental settings. Note: We clean environmental surfaces only - your team handles instrument sterilization and clinical equipment."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does dental office cleaning cost in Nashville?",
      answer: "Dental office cleaning in Nashville starts at $175 per visit for smaller practices with 2-3 operatories. Pricing depends on number of operatories, total square footage, frequency, and any specialized needs. Call 615-961-0028 for a confidential quote for your practice."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you clean after hours?",
      answer: "Yes - most Nashville dental practices prefer evening or early morning cleaning so there's zero disruption to patient care. We arrive after your last patient and have your practice spotless before your first appointment the next day. We're flexible with dental office hours including early start times."
    },
    {
      question: "Will the same team clean our dental office each time?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Your dental practice gets a dedicated team who learns your layout, protocols, and preferences. Consistency matters in dental environments - you'll see the same trusted, background-checked professionals each visit, not rotating strangers."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes you different from janitorial services?",
      answer: "Generic janitorial services don't understand dental offices. We know the difference between an operatory and a break room. We understand cross-contamination concerns. We use appropriate disinfectants for clinical areas. And as a veteran-owned company with $2M insurance, we bring professionalism that matches your practice standards."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you serve dental practices in Brentwood and Franklin?",
      answer: "Yes! We serve dental practices throughout Williamson County including Brentwood, Franklin, Cool Springs, Spring Hill, and Nolensville. These growing communities have many dental practices, and we're proud to help them maintain impeccable environments for their patients."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you clean dental labs and specialty areas?",
      answer: "Yes. We clean dental lab areas, consultation rooms, imaging areas, and administrative spaces. For specialty practices like oral surgery with recovery areas, we adapt our protocols accordingly. Tell us about your specific setup and we'll customize our approach."
