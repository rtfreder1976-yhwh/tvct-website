    {
      question: "How long does a deep cleaning take in Nashville?",
      answer: "A typical Nashville deep cleaning takes 3-6 hours depending on home size and condition. A 2-bedroom home usually takes 3-4 hours, while larger homes may take 5-6+ hours. We focus on quality over speed to ensure every area is thoroughly cleaned."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between deep cleaning and regular cleaning?",
      answer: "Regular cleaning maintains cleanliness with surface-level tasks like dusting, vacuuming, and bathroom wipe-downs. Deep cleaning is more intensive - we clean inside appliances, behind furniture, baseboards, light fixtures, window tracks, and areas that don't get attention during regular cleaning. We recommend deep cleaning as a first service before switching to regular maintenance."
