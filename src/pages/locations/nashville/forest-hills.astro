          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Forest Hills stands as one of Middle Tennessee's most coveted residential addresses. This independent municipality, completely surrounded by Nashville, maintains its own governance and character while offering residents proximity to everything the city provides. Home values here range from $500,000 to well over $2 million, reflecting the exceptional quality of life this community delivers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            What distinguishes Forest Hills from other prestigious Nashville neighborhoods is its remarkable natural setting. Large wooded lots, some spanning multiple acres, create an atmosphere of seclusion and privacy that's increasingly rare in growing metropolitan areas. Mature hardwoods, native landscaping, and thoughtfully preserved green spaces define the community's visual character. Residents here value their connection to nature as much as their connection to Nashville.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The homes themselves reflect decades of thoughtful development. From elegant mid-century estates built when Forest Hills was first established to custom contemporary constructions, the architectural variety is united by quality and attention to detail. Many properties feature multiple living levels that follow the rolling terrain, expansive windows to capture wooded views, and outdoor living spaces that extend the home into nature.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Forest Hills residents include Nashville's business leaders, healthcare executives, entertainment industry professionals, and established families who prize privacy and quality above all. The Valley Clean Team understands these priorities and delivers cleaning services worthy of Forest Hills' distinguished reputation.
