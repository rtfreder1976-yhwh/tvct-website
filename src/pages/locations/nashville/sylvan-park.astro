  {
    question: "What areas of Sylvan Park do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of Sylvan Park and surrounding areas including homes along Murphy Road, 51st Avenue, Charlotte Pike, and throughout the historic Sylvan Park neighborhood. From beautifully restored 1920s bungalows to modern new construction, we bring quality cleaning services to every Sylvan Park residence."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have experience with Sylvan Park's historic bungalows?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Sylvan Park is renowned for its charming 1920s Craftsman bungalows and cottages. We understand the care these homes require - from original hardwood floors and built-in cabinetry to vintage tile and period fixtures. We use appropriate techniques that respect and preserve historic features while achieving a thorough clean."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle smaller floor plans efficiently?",
    answer: "Many Sylvan Park homes feature efficient floor plans under 2,000 square feet. We've perfected our approach for these cozy spaces, ensuring thorough cleaning without the premium pricing of services designed for large estates. You get professional quality at rates that make sense for bungalow-sized homes."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around my work-from-home schedule?",
    answer: "Yes! Many Sylvan Park residents work from home or have flexible schedules. We can work around your schedule, cleaning rooms you're not using, or come at times that work best for your routine. Just let us know your preferences and we'll accommodate your work-from-home needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean outdoor living spaces common in Sylvan Park?",
    answer: "Sylvan Park homes often feature wonderful porches, screened sunrooms, and outdoor living areas. We can include these spaces in your regular service - sweeping porches, wiping down furniture, and ensuring your outdoor spaces are as welcoming as your indoor rooms."
  },
  {
    question: "What products do you use for original hardwood floors?",
    answer: "Sylvan Park's original hardwoods are treasures worth protecting. We use pH-neutral, non-residue products specifically designed for hardwood floors. Our techniques clean effectively without damaging vintage finishes or leaving buildup. Your 100-year-old floors deserve and receive specialized care."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you accommodate pets in small spaces?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Sylvan Park homes have beloved pets, and we're completely pet-friendly. We use products safe for animals, work comfortably around dogs and cats, and pay extra attention to pet hair removal. Your furry family members are welcome while we clean."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer cleaning services before or after renovations?",
    answer: "Yes! Sylvan Park sees constant renovation activity as homeowners update their historic bungalows. We provide post-construction cleaning to remove renovation dust and debris, and can also prepare homes for contractors. We understand the unique dust challenges that historic home renovations create."

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Sylvan Park occupies a special place in Nashville's heart. Developed in the 1920s as one of Nashville's first planned communities, this walkable neighborhood has maintained its village character while becoming one of the city's most desirable addresses. Home values range from $400,000 to over $1 million, reflecting both the charm of original bungalows and the appeal of thoughtful renovations.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            What makes Sylvan Park unique is its sense of community. Tree-canopied streets encourage walking to local restaurants, coffee shops, and neighbors' porches. McCabe Golf Course and Park provides green space and recreation. The mix of young professionals, established families, and longtime residents creates a dynamic neighborhood where front-porch conversations still happen and people know their neighbors.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The homes themselves tell a hundred years of architectural story. Original 1920s Craftsman bungalows feature deep porches, original hardwoods, built-in bookcases, and the solid construction of a more careful era. Many have been lovingly restored and updated, adding modern kitchens and bathrooms while preserving period character. New construction fills occasional lots, designed to complement rather than overwhelm the neighborhood's scale.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Whether you're in a perfectly preserved original bungalow or a newly renovated gem, your Sylvan Park home deserves cleaning services that understand its value. The Valley Clean Team appreciates what makes this neighborhood special and delivers the quality care your home deserves.
