      question: "How much does weekly cleaning cost in Nashville?",
      answer: "Weekly house cleaning in Nashville starts at $89 per visit - that's up to 20% off our standard rates. Final pricing depends on home size, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and any add-on services. Most Nashville homes range from $89-$200 per weekly visit. Call 256-826-1100 for your exact quote."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I get the same cleaning team every week?",
      answer: "Yes! We assign a dedicated team to your Nashville home. The same cleaners come each week, learning your preferences and ensuring consistent quality. They'll know exactly how you like things done, which areas need extra attention, and any special requests you have."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I skip a week or reschedule my weekly cleaning?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Life happens - we get it. You can skip, reschedule, or adjust your weekly cleaning with 48 hours notice at no charge. Going on vacation? Just let us know. Need to move your cleaning day? No problem. We're flexible because your schedule matters."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a contract for weekly cleaning service?",
      answer: "No contracts ever! Our weekly cleaning service is completely flexible. You can cancel anytime with 48 hours notice. We earn your business every single week through consistent quality, not by locking you into agreements. Most clients stay with us for years because they love our service."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between weekly and biweekly cleaning?",
      answer: "Weekly cleaning keeps your home in pristine condition with lighter, maintenance-focused cleaning each visit. Biweekly cleaning requires more intensive work each session since dirt and dust accumulate longer. Weekly clients often find their homes stay cleaner overall and each visit takes less time."
    },
    {
      question: "What areas of Nashville do you serve for weekly cleaning?",
      answer: "We serve all Nashville neighborhoods including Belle Meade, Green Hills, Sylvan Park, The Nations, 12 South, West End, Hillsboro Village, East Nashville, Germantown, Bellevue, and surrounding Davidson County areas. We also serve Brentwood, Franklin, and Hendersonville."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with weekly cleaning?",
      answer: "Getting started is easy! Call us at 256-826-1100 or fill out our online quote form. We'll discuss your home, needs, and schedule. Most Nashville customers start with a deep cleaning, then transition to weekly maintenance. We can often start within a few days of your call."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not satisfied with a weekly cleaning?",
      answer: "Your satisfaction is guaranteed every single visit. If you're ever not happy with any aspect of your weekly cleaning, let us know within 24 hours and we'll come back to make it right - completely free. That's our promise to every Nashville client."
