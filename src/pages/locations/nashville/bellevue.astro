    answer: "Bellevue features tremendous variety, from cozy 1,500 square foot homes to spacious 4,000+ square foot properties. We customize our service to match your home's size and needs. Our pricing scales appropriately so you're paying for your actual home, not a one-size-fits-all approach."

  {
    question: "What products do you use for homes with allergy concerns?",
    answer: "We use high-quality, low-allergen cleaning products that are effective yet gentle. For families with specific allergy concerns, we can discuss product options and adjustments. Our thorough dusting and vacuuming with HEPA filtration helps reduce allergens throughout your home."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with cleaning before or after we host family gatherings?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Bellevue families often host gatherings, holiday celebrations, and get-togethers. We offer pre-event deep cleaning to ensure your home is guest-ready, and post-event cleanup to restore order. Same-day service is often available when you need help quickly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer move-in cleaning for families relocating to Bellevue?",
    answer: "Yes! Bellevue continues to attract new residents. Our move-in cleaning ensures your new home is fresh and sanitized before your family settles in. We thoroughly clean all rooms, inside cabinets and closets, and make sure your new Bellevue home is ready for your family's arrival."

            Bellevue has established itself as one of Nashville's premier family communities. Located in West Nashville along the scenic Harpeth River, this area combines natural beauty with suburban convenience. Home values range from $300,000 to over $800,000, offering options for first-time buyers and established families alike. The result is a diverse, welcoming community where neighbors know each other and kids play together.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            What draws families to Bellevue is the combination of quality schools, abundant green space, and strong community connections. The Harpeth River provides recreational opportunities, from kayaking to riverside trails. Red Caboose Park offers playground equipment and picnic areas. Local businesses along Highway 70 create a small-town feel within the larger Nashville metropolitan area. Bellevue Center and One Bellevue Place provide shopping and dining options.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Bellevue homes reflect decades of development, from established neighborhoods built in the 1970s and 1980s to newer construction in growing subdivisions. You'll find ranches, split-levels, two-stories, and contemporary designs. Many homes feature decent lot sizes, garages, and the practical layouts that make family life work. The variety means there's a Bellevue home for nearly every family's needs and budget.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Bellevue families are busy with school activities, sports, careers, and community involvement. The last thing you need is to spend precious weekend hours cleaning house. The Valley Clean Team frees up your family time by handling the cleaning professionally, consistently, and affordably.
