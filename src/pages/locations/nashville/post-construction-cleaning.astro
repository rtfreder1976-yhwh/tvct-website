  localContext={[
    "Nashville is one of America's fastest-growing cities, with construction cranes dotting the skyline from The Gulch to East Nashville. Whether it's luxury condos in Midtown, new custom homes in Green Hills, or renovated historic properties in Germantown, builders and homeowners are transforming Music City at an unprecedented pace.",
    "This construction boom creates a critical need for professional post-construction cleaning. Construction dust contains fine silica particles, drywall dust, and other debris that can damage HVAC systems, trigger respiratory issues, and settle into every crack and crevice if not properly removed. DIY cleaning simply can't match professional equipment and techniques.",
    "We've cleaned everything from high-rise condos downtown to sprawling estates in Belle Meade. Our crews understand the specific challenges of Nashville construction—the humidity that makes dust stick, the wood dust from hardwood floor installations, and the attention to detail that luxury properties demand.",
    "Whether you're a general contractor needing reliable turnover cleaning, a homeowner excited to move into your dream renovation, or a property manager preparing units for new tenants, The Valley Clean Team delivers the thorough cleaning that makes new construction truly move-in ready."

  whyChooseContent={[
    "Post-construction cleaning requires specialized knowledge, equipment, and techniques that general cleaning services simply don't have. Construction dust is incredibly fine—it embeds in surfaces, clogs HVAC filters, and requires HEPA-grade equipment to properly remove. We've invested in the professional tools and training to do it right.",
    "Nashville contractors choose us because we understand their timelines and pressures. When you need to pass final inspection, show a property to buyers, or meet a move-in deadline, we deliver. Our crews are reliable, professional, and understand that their work reflects on your project.",
    "We also understand what Nashville homeowners expect. When you've invested hundreds of thousands in a renovation or new build, you deserve a space that sparkles. Our multi-phase cleaning process ensures every surface—from inside cabinet drawers to the tops of ceiling fans—is spotless and ready for your new chapter."
