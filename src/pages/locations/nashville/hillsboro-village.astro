            Hillsboro Village and the surrounding Belmont area occupy a special place in Nashville's identity. This walkable, tree-shaded neighborhood has maintained its village character while becoming one of the city's most sought-after addresses. Home values range from $400,000 to over $1.2 million, reflecting the premium placed on authentic neighborhood living within minutes of downtown, Vanderbilt, and Belmont University.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The commercial strip along 21st Avenue South defines Hillsboro Village - the Belcourt Theatre, independent restaurants, boutique shops, and the general buzz of a neighborhood where people actually walk to do their errands. This isn't an invented entertainment district; it's an organic village that evolved over decades, anchored by the presence of two major universities and generations of residents who chose this area for its livability.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The residential streets radiating from the village center showcase Nashville's early 20th century residential architecture at its finest. Craftsman bungalows with deep porches, Tudor Revival cottages with decorative half-timbering, Colonial Revival homes with formal symmetry - these houses were built with care and have been maintained with pride. Many have been thoughtfully updated to include modern kitchens and bathrooms while preserving their historic character.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Hillsboro Village residents include Vanderbilt and Belmont faculty and staff, healthcare professionals from nearby hospitals, creative industry workers, young professionals who appreciate walkability, and longtime Nashville families. The Valley Clean Team understands what draws people to this neighborhood and delivers cleaning services worthy of these character-filled homes.
