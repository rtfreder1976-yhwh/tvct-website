    {
      question: "Why is biweekly cleaning the most popular option?",
      answer: "Biweekly cleaning hits the sweet spot for most Nashville families. It's frequent enough to prevent major buildup of dust, dirt, and grime, but budget-friendly compared to weekly service. Your home stays consistently clean, and each visit is thorough enough to feel like a reset."
    },
    {
      question: "Is biweekly cleaning every two weeks or twice a week?",
      answer: "Biweekly means every two weeks (every other week). We'll come on the same day every two weeks - for example, every other Tuesday. This gives you a predictable schedule and consistent clean home throughout the month."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I switch from biweekly to weekly or monthly?",
      answer: "Absolutely! You can adjust your cleaning frequency anytime. Many clients start biweekly and switch to weekly during busy seasons, or scale back to monthly when needed. Just let us know and we'll adjust your schedule - no penalties or fees."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a deep cleaning before starting biweekly service?",
      answer: "We recommend starting with a deep cleaning if your home hasn't been professionally cleaned recently. This gets everything to a baseline level of clean, making biweekly maintenance much more effective. After the initial deep clean, biweekly visits keep everything consistently fresh."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need to skip or reschedule a biweekly cleaning?",
      answer: "No problem! With 48 hours notice, you can skip or reschedule any biweekly cleaning at no charge. Going on vacation, having guests, or just need to move your day? We're flexible. Your satisfaction and convenience come first."
    },
    {
      question: "Will the same cleaners come every two weeks?",
      answer: "Yes! We assign a dedicated team to your home. They'll come every two weeks, learn your preferences, and deliver consistent quality. You'll build a relationship with cleaners who know your home and how you like things done."
    },
    {
      question: "What Nashville areas do you serve for biweekly cleaning?",
      answer: "We serve all of Nashville and surrounding areas including Belle Meade, Green Hills, Sylvan Park, The Nations, 12 South, East Nashville, Germantown, West End, Bellevue, Brentwood, Franklin, Hendersonville, Mt. Juliet, and more."
