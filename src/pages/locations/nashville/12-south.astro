            12 South and Wedgewood-Houston represent Nashville's evolution from Music City to It City. These neighborhoods have transformed from overlooked residential areas into two of the South's most coveted addresses. Home values range from $400,000 to well over $1.5 million, with demand consistently outpacing supply as young professionals, creatives, and entrepreneurs vie for addresses in these walkable, vibrant communities.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            12 South's transformation began with independent boutiques and local restaurants taking over the commercial strip along 12th Avenue South. Today, the neighborhood draws visitors from across the region to shop, dine, and experience Nashville's contemporary culture. Sevier Park anchors the residential community, surrounded by streets where renovated 1930s bungalows sit alongside striking new construction designed by Nashville's most innovative architects.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Wedgewood-Houston - affectionately known as WeHo - has emerged as Nashville's art district. Former industrial buildings now house galleries, artist studios, and creative businesses. The residential streets feature an eclectic mix of historic cottages undergoing careful restoration and bold contemporary homes that push architectural boundaries. Fort Negley Park and the Nashville Zoo provide green space and family amenities.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            The residents of 12 South and WeHo are as diverse as the architecture - creative professionals, tech entrepreneurs, musicians, restaurateurs, and design enthusiasts who chose these neighborhoods for their energy, walkability, and authenticity. The Valley Clean Team understands what drew you here and delivers cleaning services that match your standards.
