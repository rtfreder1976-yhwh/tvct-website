  localContext={[
    "Nashville's short-term rental market has exploded in recent years, with Music City welcoming over 15 million visitors annually for concerts, bachelorette parties, sports events, and business conferences.

  whyChooseContent={[
    "Nashville Airbnb hosts face unique challenges: tight turnaround windows between guests, peak seasons that demand reliability, and the constant pressure to maintain Superhost status. The Valley Clean Team was built to solve these exact problems.",
    "Unlike general cleaning services that treat every job the same, we specialize in vacation rental turnovers. Our cleaners understand the difference between cleaning your own home and preparing a space for paying guests who will scrutinize every detail. We don't just clean—we stage your property for 5-star reviews.",
    "Our flexible scheduling accommodates Nashville's unpredictable booking patterns. Need a same-day turnover because a guest extended their stay? We've got you covered. Have back-to-back bookings during a busy weekend? We'll coordinate multiple turnovers seamlessly. Our goal is to make your hosting business easier and more profitable."
