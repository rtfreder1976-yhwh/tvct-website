  localContext={[
    "Nashville's rental market is one of the most active in the Southeast, with thousands of residents moving in and out of apartments, condos, and homes every month. From luxury high-rises in The Gulch to historic rentals in East Nashville, move-out cleaning is essential for protecting your security deposit.",
    "Tennessee landlord-tenant law allows property managers to deduct cleaning costs from security deposits if a unit isn't returned in the same condition it was rented. In Nashville's competitive rental market where deposits can exceed $2,000, professional move-out cleaning is an investment that pays for itself.",
    "We've worked with Nashville's major property management companies and understand exactly what they look for during final inspections. The inside of the oven, behind the refrigerator, the grout in bathroom tiles, window tracks—we know the spots that fail walkthroughs and we address them all.",
    "Whether you're moving across town to a new Nashville neighborhood or relocating out of state, our move-out cleaning gives you peace of mind. You focus on the stress of moving—we'll handle making your old place spotless."

  whyChooseContent={[
    "Move-out cleaning isn't the same as regular cleaning—it requires attention to areas that accumulate grime over months or years of living. Inside cabinets that haven't been emptied, behind appliances that haven't been moved, the buildup on range hoods and bathroom exhaust fans. We tackle it all.",
    "Timing is critical during a move. You have keys to return, utilities to transfer, and a new place to set up. Our efficient crews complete thorough move-out cleanings in 3-6 hours for most apartments and homes, working around your moving schedule so you can focus on what matters.",
    "We also offer move-in cleaning for your new Nashville home. Starting fresh in a professionally cleaned space—before you unpack a single box—makes the transition to your new home that much better. Many clients book both services for a seamless moving experience."
