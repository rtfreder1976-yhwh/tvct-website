    answer: "Oak Hill features both distinguished historic estates and newly constructed luxury properties.

    answer: "Oak Hill homes frequently contain significant art collections and valuable antiques. Our team is trained to clean around these items with extreme care. We use appropriate dusting techniques, never move valuable items without explicit permission, and understand that some pieces require specialized care that goes beyond standard cleaning."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you provide service for special events at Oak Hill estates?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Oak Hill estates often host elegant gatherings, charity events, and private celebrations. We offer pre-event deep cleaning to ensure your home is immaculate for guests, and post-event cleanup to restore everything to perfection. Same-day and next-day service is often available for event needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer regular maintenance for seasonal residents?",
    answer: "Yes, we serve Oak Hill homeowners who split time between residences. We can maintain your property during absences, prepare the home before your arrival, and provide deep cleaning after extended periods away. Your Oak Hill home will always be ready when you return."

            Oak Hill occupies a singular position in Nashville's geography and social fabric. This independent city, entirely surrounded by Nashville, has maintained its exclusive character since incorporation in 1952. With home values ranging from $1 million to over $10 million, Oak Hill represents the apex of Middle Tennessee residential real estate. The Governor's Residence, numerous historic estates, and some of Nashville's most significant properties call Oak Hill home.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The estates here reflect generations of wealth, taste, and commitment to quality. Many properties span multiple acres, featuring main residences that rival the finest homes in America alongside guest houses, pool complexes, tennis facilities, and meticulously maintained grounds. The architecture ranges from Georgian and Colonial Revival masterpieces built in Oak Hill's early decades to contemporary estates designed by internationally recognized architects.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Inside these homes, you find the finest materials and craftsmanship: hand-laid marble floors, museum-quality millwork, antique fixtures sourced from European estates, and collections of art and antiques accumulated over generations. These interiors demand cleaning services that understand their significance and treat every surface, every object, with appropriate expertise and respect.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Oak Hill residents include current and former governors, corporate chairmen, entertainment industry legends, healthcare system leaders, and families whose names define Nashville history. The Valley Clean Team understands that serving these clients requires more than cleaning skill - it requires absolute discretion, unwavering reliability, and the ability to work invisibly within households where privacy is paramount.
