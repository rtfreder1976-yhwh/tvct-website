        <p>
          Lauderdale County sits in the northwest corner of Alabama along the Tennessee River, encompassing The Shoals region that's famous for its music heritage, natural beauty, and friendly communities. With approximately 93,000 residents, the county includes the cities of Florence (county seat), Muscle Shoals, Tuscumbia, and Sheffield, along with smaller towns like Killen, Rogersville, and Lexington.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the historic streets of downtown Florence to lakefront properties on Wheeler Lake near Joe Wheeler State Park, Lauderdale County offers diverse living options. The region attracts everyone from young professionals working at area employers to retirees enjoying the slower pace of Tennessee Valley life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Valley Clean Team is proud to serve Lauderdale County families with reliable, professional cleaning services. As a veteran-owned, women-led local business, we understand The Shoals community and bring the same dedication to every home we clean, whether it's a historic mansion in Florence or a cozy farmhouse in St. Florian.
