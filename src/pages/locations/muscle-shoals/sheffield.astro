  {
    question: "What areas of Sheffield do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of Sheffield and surrounding Colbert County communities. This includes downtown Sheffield, neighborhoods along Jackson Highway, Avalon Avenue, areas near Spring Park, the riverfront district, neighborhoods near Sheffield High School, and residential areas throughout the city. From historic homes to modern developments, we clean Sheffield homes with care."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work for Sheffield homes?",
    answer: "Most Sheffield homes range from $135-$300 for regular cleaning, depending on square footage and service frequency. The average Sheffield home (1,400-2,200 sq ft) typically falls in the $150-$225 range for regular service. Deep cleaning runs approximately 50% more. We offer preferred pricing for recurring weekly and bi-weekly clients. Call 256-826-1100 for your personalized quote."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean historic homes in Sheffield's older neighborhoods?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Sheffield has beautiful historic neighborhoods with homes dating from the early 1900s. We're experienced cleaning older homes with original hardwood floors, high ceilings, vintage fixtures, and period details. We use appropriate products and techniques that respect these materials while achieving modern cleanliness."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around shift schedules for TVA and industrial workers?",
    answer: "Yes! Sheffield is home to many TVA employees and industrial workers with non-traditional schedules. We accommodate rotating shifts, overnight workers, and irregular hours. Whether you work days, nights, or rotating schedules, we can find cleaning times that work for your life."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve rental properties and landlords in Sheffield?",
    answer: "Definitely! We work with Sheffield landlords and property managers for turnover cleaning between tenants, regular maintenance of rental properties, and move-in/move-out cleaning. Reliable cleaning helps protect your rental investment and keeps good tenants happy."
  },
  {
    question: "What about homes near the riverfront and Wilson Dam?",
    answer: "We serve Sheffield's riverfront areas and neighborhoods near Wilson Dam. These properties often have unique features: views, outdoor spaces, humidity considerations, and sometimes older construction. We're equipped to handle the specific needs of riverfront Sheffield homes."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean before or after events at Spring Park?",
    answer: "Yes! Sheffield families often host gatherings connected to Spring Park events, festivals, and community celebrations. We offer pre-event cleaning to prepare your home for guests and post-event cleanup to restore it afterward. Spring Park brings visitors to Sheffield; let us help you host them well."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book Sheffield cleaning?",
    answer: "For regular recurring service, a few days' notice is typically sufficient. For deep cleaning, move-in/out, or post-construction, we recommend 3-5 days when possible. Same-day service may be available for urgent needs. Call 256-826-1100 to check current availability for Sheffield."

            Sheffield holds a proud place in The Shoals' history and identity. Originally developed during the boom years of the Tennessee Valley, Sheffield grew up around industry and the working families who powered it. Today, the city maintains its blue-collar character while offering affordable housing, strong community bonds, and easy access to employment throughout The Shoals region. Sheffield is a city where neighbors know each other and hard work is respected.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Sheffield homes reflect this practical character. Properties range from charming historic homes near downtown built in the early 1900s to mid-century ranch houses to newer construction in developing areas. Home values typically range from $80,000 to over $300,000, offering affordable homeownership opportunities for families, first-time buyers, and retirees seeking value. The housing stock includes excellent bones that reward owners who maintain them.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Life in Sheffield is busy. Many residents work at TVA, in local manufacturing, healthcare, retail, or commute to Florence, Muscle Shoals, or beyond. Between work shifts, family responsibilities, community involvement, and life's demands, who has time to scrub bathrooms and dust ceiling fans? Sheffield families work hard enough during the week; they shouldn't spend weekends cleaning house.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            The Valley Clean Team serves Sheffield with the respect and affordability its residents deserve. We're not a fancy service with fancy prices. We're a veteran-owned, women-led business that does excellent work at fair rates. We show up when we say we will, clean thoroughly, and treat your home like we'd treat our own. That's the Sheffield way.
