  {
    question: "What areas of Lexington do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of Lexington and surrounding Lauderdale County, including downtown Lexington, properties along Highway 64, the areas near Joe Wheeler State Park, lakefront homes on Wheeler Lake, and rural properties throughout the western Lauderdale County corridor. Whether you're in town or on the lake, we bring premium cleaning to every Lexington home."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work for Lexington homes?",
    answer: "Most Lexington homes range from $150-$400 for regular cleaning depending on square footage, condition, and service frequency. Lakefront homes and larger properties may be higher due to size and specialized cleaning needs. Deep cleaning runs approximately 50% more than regular service. We offer discounts for recurring weekly and bi-weekly clients. Call 256-826-1100 for your personalized quote."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean lakefront homes on Wheeler Lake?",
    answer: "Yes! Many Lexington properties are situated on beautiful Wheeler Lake. We're experienced with lakefront home challenges including humidity control, dock-area tracking, and the extra cleaning needs that come with lake living. We can also coordinate cleaning around your rental schedule if you have a vacation rental property."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean vacation rentals near Joe Wheeler State Park?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Lexington's proximity to Joe Wheeler State Park makes it popular for vacation rentals and Airbnb properties. We offer turnover cleaning between guests, deep cleaning for seasonal preparation, and regular maintenance to keep your rental property guest-ready year-round."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle rural properties outside Lexington?",
    answer: "Many Lexington-area families live on larger rural properties in western Lauderdale County. We serve country homes, properties with acreage, and residences along the quieter county roads. Travel time may affect scheduling, but we're committed to serving the entire Lexington community."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your regular cleaning service?",
    answer: "Our regular cleaning includes all bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living areas, dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and surface cleaning throughout. We focus on high-traffic areas and maintain your home week-to-week. Bathrooms are scrubbed and sanitized, kitchens receive detailed attention, and all living spaces are left fresh and clean."
