      answer: "Yes! We provide weekly cleaning throughout Florence, Muscle Shoals, Sheffield, and Tuscumbia, plus surrounding communities like Killen and Rogersville. Whether you're in historic downtown Florence or riverfront Muscle Shoals, we're here to serve the entire Shoals area."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I have the same cleaning team each week?",
      answer: "Absolutely! You get the same dedicated team every single week. They'll learn your home, your preferences, and your routines. This consistency means better results and the trust that comes with familiar, professional cleaners who know your space."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need to skip a week or pause service?",
      answer: "No problem! We don't lock you into contracts. Going on vacation? Family visiting? Just let us know and we'll pause your weekly service. Need to resume? We'll pick right back up. This flexibility makes weekly cleaning work for real Shoals families."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I be home during the weekly cleaning?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Some Shoals clients prefer to be home, others leave a key. Whatever makes you comfortable. Many work-from-home clients appreciate having regular cleaning while they're in their home office - we're quiet and efficient."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes weekly cleaning better than biweekly?",
      answer: "Weekly cleaning keeps your Shoals home consistently spotless with less buildup between visits. For families with kids, pets, or busy Shoals lifestyles, weekly service means you never have that \"cleaning day\" stress. Your home stays company-ready all the time, freeing you to enjoy the Tennessee River and the music history that makes this area special."
