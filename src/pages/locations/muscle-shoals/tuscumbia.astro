    question: "What areas of Tuscumbia do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of Tuscumbia and surrounding Colbert County communities. This includes downtown Tuscumbia near Spring Park and the Alabama Music Hall of Fame, historic neighborhoods near Ivy Green (Helen Keller's birthplace), residential areas along Highway 72, newer developments, and homes throughout the 35674 zip code. From historic homes to modern construction, we clean Tuscumbia homes with care."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work for Tuscumbia homes?",
    answer: "Most Tuscumbia homes range from $135-$300 for regular cleaning, depending on square footage and service frequency. The average Tuscumbia home (1,400-2,200 sq ft) typically falls in the $150-$225 range for regular service. Deep cleaning runs approximately 50% more. We offer preferred pricing for recurring weekly and bi-weekly clients. Call 256-826-1100 for your personalized quote."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean historic homes in Tuscumbia?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Tuscumbia has beautiful historic neighborhoods with homes dating from the late 1800s and early 1900s. We're experienced cleaning older homes with original hardwood floors, high ceilings, vintage fixtures, and period details. We use appropriate products and techniques that respect these historic materials while achieving modern cleanliness."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean before or after events at Spring Park?",
    answer: "Yes! Tuscumbia hosts many events at Spring Park, including concerts, festivals, and the famous Helen Keller Festival. We offer pre-event cleaning to prepare your home for guests and post-event cleanup to restore it afterward. Let us help you host visitors during Tuscumbia's busy event seasons."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve homes near Spring Creek and the Tennessee River?",
    answer: "Definitely! We clean homes throughout Tuscumbia including areas near Spring Creek, properties with views of the Tennessee River valley, and homes in more rural settings outside the downtown core. These properties often have unique features and we adapt our service accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "What about families with children in Tuscumbia City Schools?",
    answer: "Many of our Tuscumbia clients are busy families with kids in Deshler High School, Colbert County schools, or local private schools. Between work, sports, activities, and school events, who has time to clean? We offer flexible scheduling that works around family life and use safe, effective products appropriate for homes with children."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer recurring cleaning for Tuscumbia homes?",
    answer: "Yes, recurring service is our specialty! Most Tuscumbia clients choose weekly or bi-weekly cleaning to maintain their homes consistently. You'll have the same dedicated team every visit who learns your preferences and maintains your standards. Recurring clients also receive preferred pricing."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book Tuscumbia cleaning?",
    answer: "For regular recurring service, a few days' notice is typically sufficient. For deep cleaning, move-in/out, or post-construction, we recommend 3-5 days when possible. Same-day service may be available for urgent needs. Call 256-826-1100 to check current availability for Tuscumbia."

            Tuscumbia holds a special place in American history and in The Shoals' identity. Founded in 1820 and named the county seat of Colbert County, Tuscumbia is where Helen Keller was born and raised at Ivy Green. It's home to Spring Park with its natural springs and the famous concerts that draw visitors from across the Southeast. The Alabama Music Hall of Fame celebrates the region's incredible musical heritage. This is a city where history matters and community runs deep.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Homes in Tuscumbia reflect this rich heritage. The historic district features beautiful Victorian and early 20th-century homes with original hardwood, high ceilings, and architectural details worth preserving. Throughout town you'll find solid mid-century ranch homes, family-friendly neighborhoods with established trees, and newer construction on the outskirts. Home values typically range from $80,000 to over $350,000, offering options for first-time buyers, growing families, and those seeking character and charm.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Life in Tuscumbia is full. Families balance work (many commuting to Florence, Muscle Shoals, or beyond), kids in school, community events at Spring Park, church activities, and the rhythm of small-town Alabama life. Between all of that, cleaning house falls to the bottom of the list - and weekends are too valuable to spend scrubbing bathrooms.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            The Valley Clean Team serves Tuscumbia with the respect this community deserves. We're veteran-owned, women-led, and committed to honest service at fair prices. We treat historic homes with care, work around family schedules, and deliver the consistent quality Tuscumbia families can count on.
