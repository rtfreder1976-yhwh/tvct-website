  {
    question: "Do you serve the Rogersville and East Lauderdale County area?",
    answer: "Yes! We proudly serve Rogersville and surrounding East Lauderdale County communities. Our service area includes Rogersville proper, areas along Highway 72, Anderson, Lexington, and the rural communities between Rogersville and Florence. Whether you're in town near Rogersville City Park or on a larger property in the countryside, we bring professional cleaning to your door."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work for Rogersville homes?",
    answer: "Most Rogersville homes range from $140-$325 for regular cleaning, depending on square footage, condition, and service frequency. The average 2,000-2,800 sq ft Rogersville home typically falls in the $175-$250 range for regular service. Deep cleaning costs approximately 50% more. We offer discounts for recurring weekly and bi-weekly clients. Call 256-826-1100 for your customized quote."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you accommodate rural properties with acreage?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many Rogersville families live on larger properties outside city limits. We serve rural homes, farmhouses, and properties with acreage throughout East Lauderdale County. Our teams are comfortable with longer driveways, country settings, and the unique needs of rural living. We simply ask for clear directions and access instructions."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work around farm animals and livestock?",
    answer: "We do! Rogersville is farm country, and many of our clients have horses, cattle, chickens, or other livestock. While we focus on interior home cleaning (not barns or outbuildings), we're completely comfortable working in homes where farm animals are part of daily life. We understand rural living and the unique cleaning challenges it presents."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best way to schedule cleaning while I'm at work in Florence?",
    answer: "Many Rogersville residents commute to Florence, Decatur, or Huntsville for work. We offer flexible scheduling that works around commuter schedules. Provide us with a garage code, lockbox, or smart lock access, and we'll clean while you're at work. You'll come home to a spotless house without taking time off or rearranging your day."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean homes with wood stoves and fireplaces?",
    answer: "Yes! Many Rogersville homes feature wood stoves or fireplaces for supplemental heating. We clean around these areas, handle the additional dust and ash that comes with wood burning, and maintain your hearth area. We recommend scheduling cleaning after heavy burning season for best results, though we accommodate year-round service."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with seasonal deep cleaning?",
    answer: "Definitely! Rogersville's four seasons mean different cleaning needs throughout the year. Spring cleaning after winter, fall cleaning before the holidays, and seasonal deep cleans to refresh your home are all popular services. Many clients book quarterly deep cleans alongside regular maintenance service."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes with well water or hard water stains?",
    answer: "Well water and hard water are common in rural Lauderdale County. Our teams are experienced with the mineral buildup and staining that comes with well water systems. We use appropriate products to address hard water deposits on fixtures, sinks, and showers without damaging surfaces. Regular cleaning helps prevent buildup from becoming severe."

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Rogersville represents the heart of East Lauderdale County, a community where families have put down roots for generations. Located along historic Highway 72 between Florence and the Tennessee Valley, Rogersville offers a quality of life that combines small-town values with access to regional employment centers. Residents here chose country living for a reason: more space, stronger community bonds, and a slower pace of life away from urban hustle.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Rogersville homes reflect this character. You'll find everything from historic farmhouses that have sheltered families for over a century to newer custom-built homes on spacious lots. Properties range from modest 1,500 sq ft homes to expansive 4,000+ sq ft country estates. Many feature acreage, outbuildings, gardens, and the practical touches that rural living requires. Home values typically range from $150,000 to $400,000, with some custom properties and larger estates commanding higher prices.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Life in Rogersville keeps families busy. Many residents commute to Florence, Decatur, Athens, or even Huntsville for work, leaving limited time for household chores. Between commuting, school activities, church, community involvement, and actually enjoying your country property, who has time to deep clean? That's where The Valley Clean Team comes in.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            We serve rural properties that other cleaning services won't touch. Long driveways, country settings, well water challenges, farm living, wood stoves, and the unique cleaning needs of rural homes are all within our expertise. Your Rogersville home deserves professional care, and we're honored to provide it.
