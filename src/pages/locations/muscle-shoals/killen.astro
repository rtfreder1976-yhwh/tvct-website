    question: "What areas of Killen do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all of Killen and surrounding Lauderdale County, including Killen proper, the areas along Highway 72, County Road 61 corridors, newer subdivisions near Killen High School, established neighborhoods along Greenhill Road, and rural properties with acreage. Whether you live in a newer construction home or an established property, we bring the same premium service to every Killen residence."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work for Killen homes?",
    answer: "Most Killen homes range from $150-$350 for regular cleaning depending on square footage and service frequency. New construction homes (2,000-3,500 sq ft) typically fall in the $175-$275 range for regular service. Larger custom homes on acreage may be higher. Deep cleaning runs approximately 50% more than regular service. We offer discounts for recurring weekly and bi-weekly clients. Call 256-826-1100 for your personalized quote."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around our family's schedule?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Killen families often have busy schedules with school activities, work, and sports. We offer flexible scheduling including during school hours while you're at work, early morning or late afternoon slots, and can coordinate around your family's routine. Many clients provide a garage code or smart lock access so we can clean while they're away."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean new construction homes in Killen's growing subdivisions?",
    answer: "Yes! Killen has experienced significant growth with many new subdivisions and custom-built homes. We're experienced cleaning modern open floor plans, granite and quartz countertops, LVP flooring, high ceilings, and the contemporary finishes common in newer construction. We also provide move-in cleaning for families relocating to Killen."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes with pets?",
    answer: "Many Killen families have dogs, cats, or both! We're completely pet-friendly and use products safe for animals. We can work around pets who need to stay home, focus extra attention on pet hair removal, and address any pet-related cleaning needs. Just let us know about your furry family members when scheduling."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve rural properties outside Killen town limits?",
    answer: "Yes! Many Killen-area families live on larger properties outside town limits in Lauderdale County. We serve rural homes, properties with acreage, and residences in the surrounding countryside. Travel time may affect scheduling, but we're committed to serving the entire Killen community."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your regular cleaning service?",
    answer: "Our regular cleaning includes all bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living areas, dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and surface cleaning throughout. We focus on high-traffic areas and maintain your home week-to-week. Bathrooms are scrubbed and sanitized, kitchens receive detailed attention, and all living spaces are left fresh and clean."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with post-construction cleaning after a renovation?",
    answer: "Definitely! Killen has many ongoing home improvement projects. Whether you've finished a kitchen remodel, bathroom renovation, added a room, or completed major construction, we handle post-construction cleaning. This includes removing construction dust from every surface, detailed cleaning of new fixtures, and making your renovated space move-in ready."

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Killen has transformed from a quiet rural community into one of The Shoals' most desirable places to live. Located in Lauderdale County just minutes from Florence, Killen offers families the best of both worlds: small-town charm with easy access to shopping, dining, and employment throughout The Shoals region. The community has experienced remarkable growth with new subdivisions, custom-built homes, and families relocating from across North Alabama.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Killen homes range from affordable starter properties around $150,000 to custom-built family estates exceeding $500,000. The community attracts young professionals starting families, established households seeking more space and better schools, retirees enjoying quiet country living, and commuters working in Florence, Decatur, or the Tennessee Valley. Whether you've recently built a new construction home in one of Killen's growing subdivisions or own an established property on a quiet country road, your home deserves professional care.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Life in Killen is busy. Between Killen High School activities, youth sports, community events, and careers, families barely have time to breathe, let alone keep up with housework. The Valley Clean Team gives Killen families back their weekends. Come home to a clean house instead of coming home to chores. Spend Saturday at the ball field instead of scrubbing bathrooms.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Our veteran-owned, women-led team brings the same reliability and attention to detail that Killen families value in their neighbors. We're local, we're trustworthy, and we understand that your home is your sanctuary. Let us help you protect and maintain it.
