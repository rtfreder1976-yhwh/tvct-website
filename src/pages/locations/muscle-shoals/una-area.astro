  {
    question: "Do you offer cleaning services for UNA faculty and staff?",
    answer: "Yes! We serve many University of North Alabama faculty members, administrators, and staff. We understand the demands of academic life: grading seasons, research deadlines, committee obligations, and the work that follows you home. Let us handle the cleaning so you can focus on your students, scholarship, and actually having a life outside campus."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around an academic schedule?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Academic schedules are unique: irregular hours, evening class prep, weekend grading, and semester intensity that varies dramatically. We offer flexible scheduling that accommodates faculty life. Clean during your office hours, while you're in class, or on days that work with your teaching schedule. We adapt to you."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve student housing and apartments near campus?",
    answer: "We do! While we primarily serve homeowners, we also clean rental homes, condos, and apartments in the UNA area. Move-out cleaning is especially popular for graduating students and those relocating. We help ensure you get your deposit back or leave your rental pristine for the next tenant."
  },
  {
    question: "What about homes with home offices and study spaces?",
    answer: "Many UNA-area residents work from home - faculty preparing courses, administrators handling paperwork, graduate students writing dissertations. We're experienced cleaning around home offices, respecting your papers and materials, and maintaining the productive environment you need. Your workspace stays organized while we clean around it."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve healthcare professionals near North Alabama Medical Center?",
    answer: "Yes! The UNA area is home to many nurses, physicians, and healthcare workers from North Alabama Medical Center and nearby facilities. We understand shift work, long hours, and the exhaustion that comes with healthcare careers. Come home to a clean house instead of facing chores after a 12-hour shift."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle homes near campus with lots of foot traffic?",
    answer: "Definitely. Homes near UNA often have visitors: students stopping by for office hours, colleagues for meetings, friends and family visiting. We maintain your home at a level where unexpected guests are always welcome. Regular service keeps your home consistently company-ready."
  },
  {
    question: "What areas near UNA do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve the entire UNA-adjacent area including neighborhoods along Pine Street, Court Street, Wood Avenue, and throughout Florence's historic and residential areas near campus. From historic homes in walking distance to modern houses in surrounding neighborhoods, we bring professional cleaning to your door."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does cleaning cost for homes near UNA?",
    answer: "Most UNA-area homes range from $150-$300 for regular cleaning, depending on size and service frequency. Smaller historic homes near campus may be lower; larger family homes in surrounding neighborhoods may be higher. We offer discounts for recurring weekly and bi-weekly service. Call 256-826-1100 for your personalized quote."

            The University of North Alabama anchors Florence's cultural and intellectual life. This historic campus, home to the beloved Leo the Lion mascots, draws faculty, researchers, administrators, and students from across the country. The surrounding neighborhoods blend charming historic homes within walking distance of campus with family-friendly residential areas throughout Florence.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The UNA-area community includes diverse professionals: tenured professors balancing teaching loads with research publications, instructors grading stacks of papers late into the night, administrative staff keeping the university running, graduate students pursuing advanced degrees while working, and healthcare workers from nearby North Alabama Medical Center and ECM Hospital. What unites them is demanding schedules and limited time for household chores.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Housing near UNA ranges from historic Victorian and Craftsman homes in walkable neighborhoods to modern family houses in surrounding areas. Property values range from $150,000 to over $400,000. Whether you own a charming bungalow near campus or a larger family home in adjacent neighborhoods, your time is valuable. The hours you spend cleaning could be spent on research, course prep, family time, or actually relaxing.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            The Valley Clean Team understands academic life. We know that finals week is different from summer break, that some semesters are heavier than others, and that your home needs to function as both sanctuary and workspace. We adapt to your schedule, respect your home office, and deliver the consistent cleanliness that lets you focus on what matters.
