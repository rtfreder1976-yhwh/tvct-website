    question: "What makes Cypress Lakes homes different from other neighborhoods?",
    answer: "Cypress Lakes is one of The Shoals' premier master-planned golf communities. Homes here typically range from 2,200 to 4,500+ square feet, featuring modern open floor plans, high-end finishes, golf course and water views, and architectural details designed for upscale living. The community attracts professionals, executives, and retirees who expect their homes to reflect their success."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have experience cleaning golf community homes?",
    answer: "Yes! We serve multiple golf communities throughout North Alabama, including homes on Robert Trent Jones Trail courses. We understand the expectations of golf community residents: consistent, reliable service that keeps your home company-ready for spontaneous entertaining, post-round gatherings, and the active social lifestyle these communities offer."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle homes with high ceilings and specialty features?",
    answer: "Cypress Lakes homes often feature vaulted ceilings, ceiling fans, chandeliers, and two-story great rooms. Our teams bring appropriate equipment including tall ladders and extension tools to properly clean these elevated features. We're experienced with open floor plans, expansive windows that showcase views, and the architectural details common in upscale construction."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you accommodate our active social calendar?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Cypress Lakes residents often host golfers, dinner parties, and social gatherings. We offer flexible scheduling to work around your entertaining calendar, pre-event deep cleaning to ensure your home shines for guests, and post-event cleanup when needed. Your home stays guest-ready year-round with regular service."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your regular cleaning for Cypress Lakes homes?",
    answer: "Our regular service includes all living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, dusting, vacuuming, and mopping. For Cypress Lakes' larger homes, we pay special attention to expansive great rooms, gourmet kitchens with premium appliances, master suites, and the multiple living spaces common in these properties. Same team each visit for consistency."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer service while we're at the club or traveling?",
    answer: "Yes! Many Cypress Lakes residents prefer cleaning during golf rounds or while traveling. Provide us with gate codes and home access, and we'll clean while you're enjoying the course. For frequent travelers, we can maintain your home on a regular schedule so it's always pristine when you return."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle gated community access?",
    answer: "We're familiar with gated community protocols. You simply provide your community gate code and any specific access instructions. Our teams arrive professionally, follow community rules, and maintain discretion. We can coordinate timing to work around any HOA guidelines about service vehicle hours."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Cypress Lakes home cleaning cost?",
    answer: "Most Cypress Lakes homes (2,500-4,000 sq ft) range from $225-$400 for regular cleaning, depending on size, layout, and service frequency. Larger estate homes may be higher. Deep cleaning typically costs 50% more than regular service. We offer preferred pricing for recurring weekly or bi-weekly clients. Call 256-826-1100 for your customized quote."

            Cypress Lakes stands as one of The Shoals' premier residential golf communities. This meticulously planned development combines championship golf with upscale living, attracting executives, professionals, successful retirees, and families who've achieved a lifestyle that deserves to be enjoyed, not spent cleaning. Properties in Cypress Lakes represent some of the finest homes in the Florence area.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">

Cypress Lakes features custom and semi-custom homes ranging from 2,200 to over 4,500 square feet, with property values from $300,000 to well over $600,000. These residences showcase modern architectural styles with open floor plans, soaring ceilings, expansive windows framing golf course and water views, gourmet kitchens, luxurious master suites, and outdoor living spaces designed for entertaining.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The Cypress Lakes lifestyle is active and social. Residents enjoy golf at their doorstep, community events, dinner parties, and the camaraderie that comes with country club living. Your home is always potentially hosting guests, whether it's post-round drinks on the patio, holiday gatherings, or impromptu entertaining. You need your home company-ready at all times.
          </p>
