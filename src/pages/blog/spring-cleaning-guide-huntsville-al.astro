        <!-- WHY SPRING CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Spring Cleaning Matters in Huntsville</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Spring cleaning isn't just tradition—it serves real purposes, especially in North Alabama:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Pollen invasion:</strong> Huntsville's tree pollen season is brutal, typically peaking in late March. That yellow dust infiltrates your home through every opening, settling on surfaces, in HVAC systems, and on soft furnishings.</li>
          <li><strong>New construction dust:</strong> If you're in Madison's newer developments or anywhere construction is happening nearby, you're dealing with additional dust infiltration.</li>
          <li><strong>Winter accumulation:</strong> Homes stay sealed during cooler months, trapping dust, pet dander, and stale air. Spring cleaning clears the backlog.</li>
          <li><strong>Humidity prep:</strong> Alabama summers bring serious humidity. Cleaning thoroughly now prevents moisture from combining with dust to create musty conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Allergy relief:</strong> Deep cleaning removes accumulated allergens, providing relief as outdoor pollen counts rise.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- TIMING -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Best Time for Spring Cleaning in Huntsville</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Optimal window: Mid-March to early April.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Check local pollen forecasts—once counts drop from "extremely high" to "moderate," it's time to clean. In Huntsville, this typically happens in late March or early April. Clean too early and you'll just accumulate more pollen; wait too long and humidity makes the job harder.
        </p>

          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Huntsville Spring Cleaning Timeline</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Late February - Early March:</strong> Plan and declutter, schedule professional help (they book up fast)</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-March - Early April:</strong> Prime deep cleaning window</li>
            <li><strong>Late April:</strong> Last chance before humidity climbs</li>
            <li><strong>May onward:</strong> Transition to maintenance mode</li>

            <strong>Huntsville Pro Tip:</strong> Spring is the busiest season for cleaning companies. If you want professional help, book 2-3 weeks ahead—especially for weekend appointments.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          For Huntsville's busy professional population, the DIY vs. hire decision often comes down to time value:

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3"><strong>Cost:</strong> $30-75 in supplies</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3"><strong>Best for:</strong> Those with time availability and physical ability for intensive work</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600"><strong>Challenges:</strong> High areas, moving heavy furniture, reaching behind appliances, thorough window cleaning</p>
          </div>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3"><strong>Time:</strong> 4-8 hours (team effort)</p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3"><strong>Best for:</strong> Busy professionals, families with demanding schedules, anyone valuing their weekend</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600"><strong>Advantages:</strong> Commercial equipment, trained efficiency, thorough results without your effort</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>The math for Huntsville professionals:</strong> If deep cleaning takes 20 hours DIY and costs $300 to outsource, you're paying $15/hour to reclaim that time. For most Huntsville professionals earning well above that rate, hiring makes financial sense—not to mention the quality-of-life value of a free weekend.

            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">🌸 Pollen Control Strategy</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Upgrade to high-MERV HVAC filters during pollen season. Run portable air purifiers in bedrooms. Keep windows closed during peak pollen hours (typically morning). Wipe down surfaces frequently during the worst weeks.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-600">If you're in Madison, Hampton Cove, or any rapidly developing area, construction dust is an additional challenge. Pay extra attention to air filters, window tracks, and any gaps in weatherstripping where fine dust enters.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-600">Homes in wooded areas face extra pollen and organic debris. Clean gutters (or hire it done), check for any moisture issues from winter runoff, and pay attention to areas where leaves may have accumulated.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Professional spring deep cleaning in Huntsville costs $225-$400 for a typical 3-bedroom home. Larger homes in Hampton Cove or Madison may run higher. This covers intensive tasks that standard cleaning doesn't address.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Spring cleaning is more intensive—it covers annual tasks like inside windows, behind appliances, inside refrigerators/ovens, ceiling fans, baseboards, and deep carpet cleaning. Regular cleaning maintains surfaces; spring cleaning resets the entire home.

              For most Huntsville professionals, yes. A thorough DIY spring clean takes 15-25 hours. Professional teams complete it in 4-8 hours. If your time is valuable (and weekends are precious), outsourcing makes financial and lifestyle sense.
