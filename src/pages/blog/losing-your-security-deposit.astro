          You're moving out. You've packed everything. Cleaned what you could. Turned in your keys and waited for that security deposit to hit your account.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Then the letter arrives. Or the email. Or the phone call.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 font-bold">
          "After inspection, we're deducting $847 for cleaning costs."
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Your stomach drops. That's YOUR money. You cleaned the place. What gives them the right?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you're planning to move out of a rental anywhere in Huntsville, Nashville, Birmingham, or the Tennessee Valley, you need to understand exactly what you're up against—and how to make sure every dollar of your deposit comes back to you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Game Is Rigged (But You Can Still Win)</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Let's be honest about something: Many landlords and property management companies treat security deposits as bonus income.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Not all of them. There are plenty of fair, honest landlords out there. But the system makes it very easy to deduct cleaning fees, and very hard for tenants to fight back.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's why: When you hand over a security deposit—often $1,000, $1,500, even $2,000 or more—that money sits in your landlord's control. When it's time to get it back, you have to prove you deserve it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>The burden of proof is on you.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          And "cleaning" is one of the easiest deductions to justify. Unlike obvious damage like holes in walls or broken fixtures, "cleaning" is subjective. What looks clean to you might not look clean to them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What Landlords Actually Look For</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          After working with hundreds of move-out cleans, we know exactly what property managers check. Here's their actual inspection checklist:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The Kitchen</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Inside the oven:</strong> The #1 place tenants forget. Grease buildup = automatic charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Behind and under the stove:</strong> They pull it out. They always pull it out.</li>
          <li><strong>Inside the microwave:</strong> Especially the vent filter underneath.</li>
          <li><strong>Refrigerator shelves, drawers, and seals:</strong> They look inside. They look at the rubber gaskets.</li>
          <li><strong>Under the refrigerator:</strong> Dust bunnies from 2019 live there.</li>
          <li><strong>Range hood and filters:</strong> Grease buildup is a huge flag.</li>
          <li><strong>Cabinet interiors:</strong> All of them. Including above the fridge.</li>
          <li><strong>Dishwasher interior:</strong> Including the filter at the bottom.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The Bathrooms</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Toilet base and behind:</strong> They get down and look. Yes, really.</li>
          <li><strong>Grout lines:</strong> Discolored grout = cleaning charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Exhaust fan:</strong> Remove the cover and look. It's probably disgusting.</li>
          <li><strong>Under the sink:</strong> Inside the cabinet, around the pipes.</li>
          <li><strong>Shower door tracks:</strong> Soap scum builds up in the metal tracks.</li>
          <li><strong>Medicine cabinet interior:</strong> They open it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Throughout the Home</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Baseboards:</strong> Every single one. Dust and scuff marks count.</li>
          <li><strong>Light fixtures:</strong> Dead bugs inside = charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Ceiling fan blades:</strong> Top side, not just bottom.</li>
          <li><strong>Window tracks:</strong> They run a finger through. Dirt = charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Blinds:</strong> Each slat. Both sides.</li>
          <li><strong>Door frames and tops of doors:</strong> Dust accumulates there.</li>
          <li><strong>Inside closets:</strong> Shelves, floors, walls.</li>
          <li><strong>HVAC vents:</strong> Remove and look inside.</li>
          <li><strong>Garage floor:</strong> Oil stains, general cleanliness.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>This isn't paranoia. This is what they actually do.</strong> We've talked to property managers. We've seen the inspection forms. This is the standard.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Math They Use Against You</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's where it gets really frustrating. Let's say your landlord decides the apartment needs professional cleaning because you missed some spots. What do they charge?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Not what it actually costs them. They charge what their "preferred vendor" bills—often marked up 30-50% over market rate. Or they charge their own "internal cleaning fee" which has zero connection to actual cleaning costs.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          We've seen property managers charge:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>$75 to clean an oven (takes us about 20 minutes)</li>
          <li>$200 to clean blinds (we do it as part of a standard clean)</li>
          <li>$150 for "carpet cleaning" that's just vacuuming</li>
          <li>$400+ for a "deep clean" that you could have gotten done for $199</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>They're not cleaning at those prices. They're profiting.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What You Can Legally Be Charged For</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's something most tenants don't know: There are limits on what landlords can deduct. The rules vary by state, but in Alabama and Tennessee:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Normal wear and tear cannot be deducted.</strong> Carpet that's worn from regular walking? That's normal. Minor scuffs on walls? Normal. Small nail holes from pictures? Usually normal.</li>
          <li><strong>They must return your deposit within a set timeframe</strong> (35 days in Alabama, varies in Tennessee) with an itemized list of deductions.</li>
          <li><strong>Deductions must be reasonable and documented.</strong> They can't just say "cleaning - $500" without specifics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The problem? Most tenants don't know these rules. Most tenants don't challenge unfair deductions. Landlords count on you not fighting back.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Move-Out Cleaning Strategy That Works</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you want your full deposit back, here's exactly what you need to do:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 1: Document Everything Before You Clean</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Take photos and video of the entire place before your move-out clean. Timestamp them. This establishes the "before" baseline.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 2: Get a Professional Move-Out Clean</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          This is not optional if you want your full deposit. I know—you think you can do it yourself. Maybe you can. But here's the reality:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>You're exhausted from packing and moving</li>
          <li>You probably don't have the right products or equipment</li>
          <li>You don't know what inspectors actually look for</li>
          <li>You'll miss things. Everyone does.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          A professional move-out clean costs $199-400 depending on size. Your security deposit is probably $1,000-2,000. The math is obvious.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 3: Get a Receipt</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          When you hire professional cleaners, get an itemized receipt showing exactly what was done. This is your proof. If the landlord tries to charge for cleaning, you have documentation that the place was professionally cleaned.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 4: Document Everything After the Clean</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Take detailed photos and video after the clean. Get inside the oven. Get behind the toilet. Get the window tracks. Every spot they might check, you document.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Date and timestamp everything. Email the photos to yourself so there's a permanent record with a verifiable date.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 5: Do a Walk-Through If Possible</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Request a move-out walk-through with your landlord or property manager present. Some states require landlords to offer this. Get them to sign off on the condition or note any issues in real-time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">When They Deduct Anyway (And What to Do)</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Sometimes, despite doing everything right, you'll still get hit with deductions. Here's how to fight back:
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>1. Request itemized documentation.</strong> They must provide specific charges, not just a total. "Cleaning - $400" isn't enough. What cleaning? Where?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>2. Send a formal dispute letter.</strong> Certified mail. Reference your documentation. Include your photos and cleaning receipt.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>3. Know your state's penalties.</strong> In Alabama, landlords who wrongfully withhold deposits can be liable for double the amount. That's a powerful leverage point.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>4. Small claims court is an option.</strong> It's cheap to file, you don't need a lawyer, and landlords often settle rather than deal with the hassle.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Most disputes never get to court. A well-documented dispute letter is usually enough to get unfair charges reversed—especially when you can prove the place was professionally cleaned.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Real Cost of DIY Move-Out Cleaning</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Let's run the numbers one more time:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Your time:</strong> 6-10 hours of exhausting work after you've already moved</li>
          <li><strong>Cleaning supplies:</strong> $30-75 (assuming you don't already have them)</li>
          <li><strong>Risk of missing something:</strong> $200-800 in deductions</li>
          <li><strong>Stress and hassle:</strong> Priceless (but not in a good way)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>VS. Professional Move-Out Clean:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $199-400</li>
          <li><strong>Your time:</strong> Zero (do it while you're handling the move)</li>
          <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Dramatically lower (we know what inspectors look for)</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Professional receipt proving cleaning was done</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The professional clean often costs less than the deductions you'd face otherwise. And you don't have to spend your last hours in that apartment scrubbing an oven on your hands and knees.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What Our Move-Out Clean Includes</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          When we do a move-out clean, we hit every single item on those property manager inspection lists:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Complete oven and range cleaning (inside and out)</li>
          <li>Refrigerator interior and exterior (including seals)</li>
          <li>All appliance cleaning</li>
          <li>Cabinet interiors</li>
          <li>All bathroom fixtures, tile, and grout</li>
          <li>Baseboards throughout</li>
          <li>Window tracks and blinds</li>
          <li>Light fixtures and ceiling fans</li>
          <li>All floors (vacuumed, mopped, or both)</li>
          <li>Door frames and closet interiors</li>
          <li>HVAC vents</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          We know what they look for because we've dealt with hundreds of move-outs across Huntsville, Nashville, Birmingham, and the entire Tennessee Valley region. We know the game, and we make sure you win it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Your security deposit is your money. You earned it. You saved it. You handed it over in good faith.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Don't let someone take it because you missed a spot behind the toilet or didn't know to clean inside the range hood.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Get it done right. Get documentation. Get your full deposit back.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>That's money you can use for your new place. Your new beginning. Your future.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Don't leave it behind.
