        <!-- WHY MOVE-OUT CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Move-Out Cleaning Matters</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's the reality: most landlords and property managers in Florence will deduct cleaning costs from your security deposit if the home isn't spotless. Typical deductions range from $200-$400—often more than professional cleaning would cost.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Math That Matters</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Professional move-out cleaning:</strong> $250-$400</li>
            <li><strong>Typical landlord cleaning deduction:</strong> $200-$400</li>
            <li><strong>What landlords charge if they hire someone:</strong> Often $300-$500+ (they're not shopping for deals)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">Hiring professionals yourself almost always costs less than what your landlord will charge—and you control the quality.</p>

            <li><strong>2 weeks before move:</strong> Book your move-out cleaning appointment</li>

            <li><strong>Day after move:</strong> Professional cleaning (empty home = best results)</li>
            <li><strong>Final walkthrough:</strong> Schedule 1-2 days after cleaning</li>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Why schedule after moving out?</strong> Cleaning an empty home is more thorough and efficient. We can access all areas—inside closets, behind where furniture was, entire floor surfaces. The result is noticeably better.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-0">
            <strong>Booking tip:</strong> Month-end is the busiest time for move-out cleanings. If your lease ends on the 30th or 31st, book at least 2 weeks ahead. Mid-month moves often have more availability.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Move-out cleaning in Florence costs $250-$400 for a typical 3-bedroom home. Apartments run $175-$325 depending on size. This is more than standard cleaning because it includes inside appliances, cabinets, and detailed inspection-ready cleaning.

              Schedule for the day after you've removed all belongings but before your final walkthrough. This is typically 1-2 days before your lease ends. Book at least 1-2 weeks ahead, especially for month-end moves.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need move-out cleaning if I cleaned regularly?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Usually yes. Even well-maintained homes have areas regular cleaning misses—inside ovens, behind toilets, cabinet interiors, window tracks. Landlords inspect these areas specifically. Move-out cleaning addresses everything.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Does move-out cleaning include carpet cleaning?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Basic move-out cleaning includes thorough vacuuming. Professional carpet shampooing/steam cleaning is usually an add-on service ($75-$150+ depending on area). Check your lease—some require professional carpet cleaning.
