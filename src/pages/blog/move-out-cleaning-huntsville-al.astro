        <!-- WHY MOVE-OUT CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Move-Out Cleaning Matters in Huntsville</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Huntsville's competitive rental market means property managers are thorough. They know they can fill vacancies quickly, so they're particular about move-out condition. Most will deduct cleaning costs from your deposit if the home isn't spotless—typically $250-$500.
        </p>

          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Professional move-out cleaning:</strong> $275-$450</li>
            <li><strong>Typical landlord cleaning deduction:</strong> $250-$500</li>
            <li><strong>What property managers charge if they hire someone:</strong> Often $400-$600+ (they use their preferred vendors)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">Hiring professionals yourself almost always costs less than what your landlord will charge—and you control the quality and timing.</p>
