            <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Spring cleaning in Florence, AL should happen mid-March to early April—after the worst pollen passes but before summer humidity arrives. A thorough spring clean includes deep cleaning all rooms, washing windows, cleaning ceiling fans and light fixtures, addressing baseboards, and tackling the accumulated dust and allergens from winter. Professional spring cleaning costs $200-$350 for a typical Florence home.

        <!-- WHY SPRING CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Spring Cleaning Matters in the Shoals</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Spring cleaning isn't just tradition—it's practical.</strong> Here's why it matters in our area:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Pollen accumulation:</strong> The Shoals gets hit hard with tree pollen from late February through April. All that yellow dust doesn't stay outside—it infiltrates your home through doors, windows, HVAC systems, and on your clothes and pets.</li>
          <li><strong>Winter buildup:</strong> Homes stay closed up during winter, trapping dust, pet dander, and stale air. Spring cleaning clears out what accumulated.</li>
          <li><strong>Humidity prep:</strong> Alabama summers bring serious humidity. Deep cleaning now prevents moisture from combining with dust to create mustiness later.</li>
          <li><strong>Pest prevention:</strong> A thorough spring clean removes crumbs and debris that attract ants and other pests as temperatures rise.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- TIMING -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Best Time for Spring Cleaning in Florence</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Ideal window: Mid-March to early April.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Wait until the heaviest pollen has passed (usually late March in the Shoals), but don't wait too long. Once humidity climbs in May, deep cleaning becomes more challenging—and less pleasant.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Florence Spring Cleaning Calendar</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Late February - Early March:</strong> Start planning, declutter, schedule professional help if needed</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-March - Early April:</strong> Prime spring cleaning window</li>
            <li><strong>Late April:</strong> Final window before humidity rises</li>
            <li><strong>May+:</strong> Focus shifts to maintenance cleaning</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're hiring a cleaning service, book 2-3 weeks ahead during spring. This is the busiest season for cleaning companies.

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">🌸 Pollen Management</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Change HVAC filters to high-efficiency versions during pollen season. Consider running air purifiers in bedrooms. Wipe down surfaces more frequently during peak pollen weeks.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">🏠 Older Shoals Homes</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Many Florence and Tuscumbia homes are historic. Pay extra attention to window tracks and door seals where dust accumulates in older construction. Check for any moisture issues after winter.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">🌡️ Humidity Prep</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Clean ceiling fans now—you'll be running them constantly soon. Check dehumidifier if you have one. Clean under sinks to prevent moisture buildup.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
