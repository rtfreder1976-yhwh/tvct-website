        <!-- WHY MOVE-OUT CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Move-Out Cleaning Matters in Nashville</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Nashville's competitive rental market means property managers are thorough—and they know vacancies fill quickly. Most will deduct cleaning costs from your deposit if the home isn't spotless. Typical deductions in Nashville: $300-$600 or more.

            <li><strong>Restore to market condition:</strong> If selling, the property needs to show well. Move-out cleaning gets it there.</li>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How much does move-out cleaning cost in Nashville?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Move-out cleaning in Nashville costs $300-$500 for a typical 3-bedroom home. Belle Meade, Green Hills, and Franklin run $500-$750+ due to larger homes. Downtown condos typically cost $225-$400. Nashville pricing is 20-30% higher than Alabama markets.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">When should I schedule move-out cleaning?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Schedule for the day after you've moved out but before your final walkthrough. Book at least 2-3 weeks ahead in Nashville—this is an extremely competitive market and month-end appointments fill very quickly.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do Nashville Airbnb owners need move-out cleaning?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              If you're ending an Airbnb lease or selling an STR property, yes. Short-term rentals see heavy use and need thorough move-out cleaning to restore them to market condition. This is more intensive than regular turnover cleaning.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Does move-out cleaning include carpet cleaning?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Basic move-out cleaning includes thorough vacuuming. Professional carpet shampooing is usually an add-on ($125-$250+ depending on area). Many Nashville leases require professional carpet cleaning—check your agreement.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Will move-out cleaning guarantee I get my deposit back?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Professional cleaning significantly improves your chances, but deposits can also be withheld for damage (not just cleanliness). Cleaning addresses the cleanliness portion—often $300-$600+ of potential deductions in Nashville.
