        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What Is Professional House Cleaning?</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Professional house cleaning</strong> is a service where trained cleaning specialists clean your home using commercial-grade equipment and products. Unlike DIY cleaning, professional services follow systematic processes to ensure consistent results, and reputable companies carry insurance to protect your home and belongings.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Professional cleaning typically includes dusting, vacuuming, mopping, bathroom sanitization, and kitchen cleaning. Deep cleaning services add more intensive tasks like inside appliances, baseboards, and window tracks.
        </p>

        <!-- LOCAL CONTEXT -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Athens Residents Choose Local Cleaning Services</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Athens sits at the crossroads of I-65 and Highway 72, making it a convenient home base for people who work in Huntsville, Decatur, or even Nashville. That means busy commuters who don't have time to spend their weekends cleaning—and who value reliable service from people who understand the community.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Limestone County has its own character. From the historic downtown square to the newer subdivisions in East Limestone, local cleaning companies understand the mix of older homes that need extra care and newer construction with modern finishes. They know about the pollen that blankets everything in spring and the red clay that tracks through entryways year-round.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Hiring locally also means accountability. When your cleaning company is owned by someone who lives in your community, they have extra motivation to get it right.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Athens has several independent cleaners who advertise on Facebook Marketplace and local community groups. Some are excellent; others are unreliable. The challenge is vetting them properly.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Services Offered:</strong> Varies widely by individual.</p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Always verify insurance coverage, ask for references, and start with a trial cleaning. Many independent cleaners don't carry liability insurance, which puts you at risk. Pricing can be lower, but you often get what you pay for.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Some Huntsville cleaning companies extend their service area to include Athens. This can work well, though you may experience longer wait times for scheduling and less flexibility.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Services Offered:</strong> Full range of residential cleaning services.</p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">

        <!-- HOW-TO SECTION - AEO Magnet -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">How to Choose a Cleaning Company in Athens: 5 Steps</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Selecting the right cleaning service protects both your home and your peace of mind. Follow these steps to make a confident decision:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Verify Insurance and Bonding</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Before allowing anyone into your home, confirm the company carries liability insurance and is bonded. This protects you if accidents happen. <strong>Ask directly:</strong> "Can you provide proof of insurance?" This is especially important when considering independent cleaners in Athens.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Read Local Reviews (Not Just Star Ratings)</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Look for reviews on Google and Facebook from people in Athens and Limestone County specifically. Pay attention to comments about reliability, communication, and whether the same cleaners come each visit.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Ask About Their Cleaning Process</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Professional companies should be able to explain exactly what's included in their service. Vague answers like "we clean everything" are a red flag. Request a written checklist so you know what to expect.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Get Pricing in Writing</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Reputable cleaners provide clear quotes before the job. Be cautious of companies that won't give estimates or add surprise charges after. Standard house cleaning in Athens typically ranges from $125-$250 depending on home size.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Start with a Single Cleaning</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Before committing to a recurring plan, book a one-time cleaning to test the service. This lets you evaluate their work without a long-term commitment.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-[#FFA985]/10 border-l-4 border-[#FFA985] p-6 mb-8 rounded-r-lg">
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-0">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The Valley Clean Team offers a satisfaction guarantee on every cleaning—if you're not happy, they'll make it right. That removes the risk from trying a new service.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Standard cleaning covers regular maintenance: vacuuming, mopping, bathroom sanitizing, dusting, and kitchen cleaning. Deep cleaning adds intensive tasks like inside appliances, baseboards, window tracks, ceiling fans, and detailed scrubbing—typically needed seasonally or before starting recurring service.

              Yes, most cleaning companies based in or serving Athens also cover surrounding Limestone County communities including Elkmont, Ardmore, Tanner, East Limestone, and Clements. The Valley Clean Team serves all of Limestone County and surrounding areas.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              That's entirely your preference. Many clients provide a door code or spare key and aren't home during cleanings. Trustworthy companies conduct background checks on all staff. If you prefer to be present for your first cleaning, that's completely reasonable.
