                    Why Hire a Professional Cleaning Service?

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    <strong>Professional cleaning</strong> goes beyond just tidying.
                    It involves trained specialists using commercial-grade products
                    to sanitize your home efficiently and safely.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    Reputable companies carry insurance, pay payload taxes, and
                    perform background checks. This protects you in a way that
                    "under the table" arrangements cannot.

                    1. Verify Insurance
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    Never hire an uninsured cleaner. If they damage your floors
                    or get injured in your home, you could be liable. Ask for
                    proof of Certificate of Insurance (COI).

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">

                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    Look for recent reviews from Decatur residents. A company
                    with 4.9 stars from 100+ reviews is much safer than an
                    unknown entity.

                    3. Ask About Satisfaction Guarantees
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    What happens if something is missed? A professional company
                    will return to reclean for free. An individual might just
                    ghost you.
