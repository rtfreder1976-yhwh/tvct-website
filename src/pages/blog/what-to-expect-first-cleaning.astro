        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          You've decided to hire a cleaning service. Maybe for the first time ever. You're excited about coming home to a clean house, but you're also a little nervous. What exactly happens? What should you do to prepare? What if something goes wrong?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Totally normal feelings. Let's walk through exactly what to expect so there are no surprises.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Before the Cleaning: What to Do</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">1. Don't Pre-Clean</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          This is the #1 mistake first-time clients make. They frantically clean before the cleaners arrive because they're embarrassed.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Please don't do this.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          We've seen everything. We're not judging. We're here to help. If you pre-clean, you're paying us to clean an already-clean house, and we can't address the real problems.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The only exception: pick up clutter that would prevent us from cleaning surfaces. Clothes on the floor, toys scattered everywhere, papers on counters. We can't clean underneath things if we can't access the surface.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">2. Declutter Surfaces (Just the Basics)</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          We need to access surfaces to clean them. That means:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Clear countertops of items you don't want moved</li>
          <li>Pick up clothes from floors</li>
          <li>Clear bathroom counters</li>
          <li>Move laundry off the floor</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          We're not asking for perfection. Just basic access to surfaces.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">3. Secure Valuables</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Any reputable cleaning service backgrounds checks their employees. But for your own peace of mind, secure:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Cash</li>
          <li>Jewelry</li>
          <li>Important documents</li>
          <li>Prescription medications</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Not because we'll take them—but because if something goes missing and you haven't secured it, there's no way to know what happened. It protects both of us.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">4. Handle Your Pets</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Most cleaners love animals! But pets can get in the way, get stressed by strangers, or escape through open doors.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Options:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Confine pets to one room we clean last</li>
          <li>Crate them during cleaning</li>
          <li>Have a friend take them for a few hours</li>
          <li>Let us know if your pet is friendly and can roam freely</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">5. Leave Access Instructions</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Will you be home? If not, how do we get in? Options include:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>You'll be home to let us in</li>
          <li>Garage code</li>
          <li>Lockbox with key</li>
          <li>Smart lock code</li>
          <li>Hidden key (we'll ask where)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Many clients prefer not being home during cleaning. That's totally fine—and sometimes preferred, since we can work more efficiently without working around you.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">6. Communicate Your Priorities</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Every home is different. Every client has different priorities. Let us know:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Problem areas:</strong> "The kids' bathroom is a disaster" or "The kitchen gets really greasy"</li>
          <li><strong>Off-limits areas:</strong> "Please don't go in the home office" or "Skip the guest room"</li>
          <li><strong>Fragile items:</strong> "Those figurines are antiques, please be careful"</li>
          <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> "My daughter has fragrance sensitivity" (we offer fragrance-free options)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">During the Cleaning: What Happens</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">We'll Do a Walkthrough</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          On your first visit, we'll do a quick walkthrough of your home. This helps us:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Understand the layout</li>
          <li>Note any existing damage (so we're not blamed for it later)</li>
          <li>Identify your priorities</li>
          <li>Estimate accurate time for future visits</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you're not home, we'll do this ourselves and contact you with any questions.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">We Follow a Systematic Approach</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Professional cleaners don't just wander around randomly. We have a system:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Top to bottom:</strong> Dust falls down, so we start high and work down</li>
          <li><strong>Room by room:</strong> Complete each room before moving to the next</li>
          <li><strong>Kitchen and bathrooms get extra attention:</strong> These are the high-touch, high-germ areas</li>
          <li><strong>Floors last:</strong> After everything else is done, we vacuum and mop</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Typical Timeframe</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          For a standard 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>First/deep cleaning:</strong> 3-5 hours</li>
          <li><strong>Recurring cleaning:</strong> 2-3 hours</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The first cleaning always takes longer. We're learning your home, addressing accumulated dirt, and establishing a baseline. Subsequent cleanings are maintenance, so they're faster.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">After the Cleaning: What to Check</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Do a Quick Walk-Through</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          When we finish (or when you get home), take a few minutes to look around. Check:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Kitchen counters, stove, sink</li>
          <li>Bathrooms—toilets, sinks, showers</li>
          <li>Floors—vacuumed, mopped</li>
          <li>Dusted surfaces</li>
          <li>Any specific areas you asked us to focus on</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Give Feedback Immediately</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If something was missed or not up to your standards, <strong>tell us right away</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Any good cleaning company wants to know. We can send someone back to address it. We can adjust for next time. But we can't fix what we don't know about.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Don't suffer in silence and then write a bad review. Give us a chance to make it right.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Understand the First Cleaning Is a Starting Point</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's an honest truth: the first cleaning won't be perfect.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          We're learning your home. Learning your preferences. Figuring out the trouble spots. A good cleaning service will nail 90% on the first visit and improve from there.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          By the third or fourth cleaning, we know your home intimately—which outlets have dust buildup, which mirrors get toothpaste, where the pet hair collects. That's when the service really hits its stride.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Common First-Time Concerns (And How to Handle Them)</h2>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">"I'm embarrassed by how dirty my house is"</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            Trust us—we've seen it all. We're not judging. We're here to help. The worse it is now, the more dramatic the transformation, and the better you'll feel when we're done.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">"What if something gets broken?"</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            That's what insurance is for. We carry $2 million in liability coverage. If we damage something, we'll make it right. This is why you should never hire an uninsured cleaner.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">"Should I stay home?"</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            Your choice! Some clients prefer to be home for the first visit, then give us a key for future cleanings. Others give us access from day one. Both are fine. Do what makes you comfortable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">"What about tipping?"</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            Tips are appreciated but not expected. If you feel we did exceptional work, a tip is a nice way to show it. Typical range is $10-$20 per cleaning or 15-20% of the service cost. But there's no obligation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">"What if I need to reschedule?"</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            Life happens! Most companies ask for 24-48 hours notice to reschedule. Last-minute cancellations may incur a fee since we've reserved that time for you.
          </p>
        </div>
