          The renovation is done. The contractors packed up and left. You're finally looking at your beautiful new kitchen, bathroom, or addition.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          A fine white powder coating everything. In the corners. On the shelves. In rooms that weren't even being worked on. You wipe a surface and your cloth comes away gray.

          <strong>Welcome to construction dust.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's what most people don't realize: That fine dust isn't just an inconvenience. It's actively damaging your home and potentially harming your health. And the longer it stays, the worse the damage gets.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What Construction Dust Actually Is</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Construction dust isn't like regular house dust. It's a different beast entirely.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Depending on what work was done, construction dust can contain:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Drywall dust:</strong> Gypsum powder that's incredibly fine and sticky</li>
          <li><strong>Concrete dust:</strong> Silica particles that are abrasive and hazardous</li>
          <li><strong>Wood dust:</strong> Can cause respiratory issues and allergic reactions</li>
          <li><strong>Sawdust:</strong> Gets into everything and is hard to fully remove</li>
          <li><strong>Paint particles:</strong> May contain chemicals and VOCs</li>
          <li><strong>Insulation fibers:</strong> Irritating to lungs and skin</li>
          <li><strong>In older homes: Lead and asbestos:</strong> Seriously dangerous materials</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          This isn't dust you can just ignore. This is a complex mixture of potentially harmful particles that requires proper removal.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Damage Happening Right Now</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          While that dust sits in your home, it's causing damage you might not see:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">To Your HVAC System</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Fine construction dust doesn't just sit on surfaces—it circulates through your air system. It clogs filters. It coats the inside of ducts. It covers the components of your heating and cooling equipment.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The result? Reduced efficiency. Higher energy bills. Premature wear on expensive equipment. And every time the system runs, it redistributes dust throughout your home.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>We've seen construction dust shorten HVAC system lifespans by years.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">To Your Electronics</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Computers, TVs, game consoles, kitchen appliances—anything with vents pulls in air and dust. Construction dust is finer and more abrasive than normal dust. It can damage internal components, cause overheating, and lead to premature failure.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          That computer that died six months after your renovation? Probably not a coincidence.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">To Your Flooring</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Construction dust—especially concrete and drywall dust—is abrasive. Walking on floors with this dust is like walking on fine sandpaper. It scratches hardwood. It wears down finishes. It grinds into carpet fibers.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The longer the dust stays, the more damage it does with every step.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">To Your Surfaces and Finishes</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Drywall dust is slightly alkaline. Left on certain surfaces—wood, stone, metal—it can cause discoloration and damage over time. It can etch into sealers. It can dull finishes.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          And here's the worst part: When drywall dust gets wet (from humidity or cleaning attempts), it turns into a paste that's even harder to remove and more likely to stain.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Health Risks You're Living With</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Beyond property damage, construction dust poses real health concerns:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Respiratory Issues</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Construction dust particles are small enough to be inhaled deep into your lungs. Silica dust from concrete work is particularly dangerous—it can cause silicosis, a serious lung disease.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Even less dangerous dust can trigger asthma, cause bronchitis-like symptoms, and worsen existing respiratory conditions.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Eye and Skin Irritation</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Fine particles irritate eyes and skin. You might notice itchiness, redness, or dryness that you can't explain. The dust you can't see is often the culprit.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Allergic Reactions</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Construction dust often contains materials that trigger allergic responses—wood species, adhesives, insulation materials. You might develop sensitivities you never had before.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Dangerous Materials</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If your home was built before the 1980s and renovation disturbed old materials, you might be dealing with lead paint dust or asbestos fibers. These are serious health hazards that require professional remediation.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>If you have any reason to suspect lead or asbestos, stop cleaning and call a specialist immediately.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Regular Cleaning Won't Work</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          After construction, many people try to clean up themselves. They vacuum. They dust. They mop. And a few days later, everything is coated again.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's why regular cleaning fails with construction dust:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The Dust Is Everywhere</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Construction dust doesn't stay where the work was done. It travels through air systems, settles in rooms that were "closed off," works its way into cabinets, closets, and storage areas.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you're only cleaning visible areas, you're missing most of the dust. And the areas you're missing keep re-contaminating the areas you cleaned.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Your Vacuum Makes It Worse</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Standard household vacuums don't have fine enough filters to capture construction dust particles. They suck up the dust and blow it right back into the air—smaller and more dispersed than before.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          You feel like you're cleaning. You're actually redistributing.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Wet Cleaning Creates Paste</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Your instinct might be to wet-mop or wipe down surfaces. But drywall dust mixed with water creates a paste that's harder to remove than the dry dust. It smears. It gets into pores and grain. It stains.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>There's a right order to clean construction dust, and wet-cleaning first is the wrong order.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">It Keeps Coming Back</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Even after multiple cleaning attempts, dust keeps appearing. From the HVAC system. From cracks and crevices. From inside cabinets and closets. From soft furnishings and upholstery.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Unless you address ALL the sources, you're fighting a losing battle.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What Professional Post-Construction Cleaning Actually Involves</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Proper post-construction cleaning is a multi-phase process:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Phase 1: Rough Clean</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Remove all debris, garbage, and visible construction materials. This happens before final finishes are installed.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Phase 2: Detail Clean</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          After finishes are in:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>HEPA vacuum all surfaces (top to bottom)</li>
          <li>Wipe all surfaces with appropriate cleaners</li>
          <li>Clean inside all cabinets, drawers, and closets</li>
          <li>Clean all fixtures and hardware</li>
          <li>Clean windows (inside and out, including frames and tracks)</li>
          <li>Clean all flooring appropriately for type</li>
          <li>Clean light fixtures and vents</li>
          <li>Address HVAC: change filters, clean vents</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Phase 3: Touch-Up Clean</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          After everything has had time to settle:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>Final dusting of all surfaces</li>
          <li>Final floor cleaning</li>
          <li>Window touch-ups</li>
          <li>Address any areas missed or re-contaminated</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>This process typically requires 2-3 separate visits over several days.</strong> The dust that's airborne during the first clean settles and needs to be removed again.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Equipment Difference</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Professional post-construction cleaning requires specialized equipment that most homeowners don't have:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>HEPA-filter vacuums:</strong> Actually capture fine particles instead of redistributing them</li>
          <li><strong>Industrial air scrubbers:</strong> Clean the air while surface cleaning happens</li>
          <li><strong>Specialized cleaning solutions:</strong> Designed for specific construction materials</li>
          <li><strong>Microfiber systems:</strong> Capture and hold dust instead of spreading it</li>
          <li><strong>Extension tools:</strong> Reach high ceilings, ductwork, and other hard-to-reach areas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What To Do Right Now</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If you've just finished construction or renovation, here's what we recommend:
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>1. Change your HVAC filter immediately.</strong> It's probably clogged. Keep the system off if possible until cleaning is done.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>2. Don't wet-clean drywall dust.</strong> Dry removal first.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>3. Don't use regular vacuums without HEPA filters.</strong> You'll make it worse.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>4. Consider what materials were disturbed.</strong> Old paint? Old insulation? If there's any chance of lead or asbestos, get testing done before cleaning.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>5. Get professional post-construction cleaning.</strong> This isn't a DIY job if you want it done right.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Cost of Waiting</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Every day that construction dust sits in your home, the damage compounds:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>More wear on your HVAC system</li>
          <li>More scratches on your floors</li>
          <li>More particles embedded in your upholstery</li>
          <li>More irritation to your lungs</li>
          <li>More dust settling into cracks and crevices where it's harder to remove</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Post-construction cleaning isn't something to put off. The sooner it's done properly, the less damage you'll have.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Protect Your Investment</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          You just spent significant money on a renovation. The last thing you want is for construction dust to damage your new finishes, ruin your new flooring, or make your family sick.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Professional post-construction cleaning isn't an extra expense—it's part of completing your project properly. It protects the investment you just made.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Don't let months of construction end with years of dust problems.</strong>
