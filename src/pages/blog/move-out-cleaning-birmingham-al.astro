        <!-- WHY MOVE-OUT CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Move-Out Cleaning Matters in Birmingham</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Birmingham's property management companies are thorough. Most will deduct cleaning costs from your deposit if the home isn't spotless—typically $250-$500 or more for larger homes. That's often more than professional cleaning would cost you directly.
        </p>

            <li><strong>Professional move-out cleaning:</strong> $275-$450 (typical home)</li>
            <li><strong>Typical landlord cleaning deduction:</strong> $250-$500</li>
            <li><strong>What property managers charge if they hire someone:</strong> Often $400-$700+ (they use preferred vendors)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">Hiring professionals yourself almost always costs less—and you control the quality and timing.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Many do, especially larger companies managing properties in Mountain Brook, Vestavia, and Homewood. Check your lease for specific requirements. Professional cleaning typically costs less than what management companies charge if they hire cleaners themselves.

              Basic move-out cleaning includes thorough vacuuming. Professional carpet shampooing is usually an add-on ($100-$200+ depending on area). Many Birmingham leases require professional carpet cleaning—check your agreement.

              Professional cleaning significantly improves your chances, but deposits can also be withheld for damage (not just cleanliness). Cleaning addresses the cleanliness portion—often $250-$500+ of potential deductions.
