        <!-- DEFINITION BLOCK -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Athens Cleaning Market Overview</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>The Athens cleaning market</strong> sits between the smaller Shoals market and the larger Huntsville market. You'll find a mix of professional companies (some based locally, others extending from Huntsville or Decatur) and independent cleaners advertising on local Facebook groups.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Limestone County's lower cost of living keeps service prices reasonable compared to Madison County. Many Athens residents commute to Huntsville for work but enjoy lower home prices and a more relaxed pace of life—the same principle applies to home services.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Independent Cleaners vs. Professional Companies</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Athens has a lot of independent cleaners advertising on Facebook Marketplace and local community groups. Here's how they typically compare to professional companies:

        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Independent Cleaners</h4>
            <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
              <li>✓ Often $20-40 less per cleaning</li>
              <li>✓ May offer more schedule flexibility</li>
              <li>✗ Usually no liability insurance</li>
              <li>✗ No backup if they're sick or quit</li>
              <li>✗ Inconsistent quality control</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
              <li>✓ Liability insurance protects you</li>
              <li>✓ Backup staff available</li>
              <li>✓ Consistent training and standards</li>
              <li>✓ Formal satisfaction guarantees</li>
              <li>✗ Typically 10-20% higher cost</li>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The choice depends on your risk tolerance. Independent cleaners can work well if you find a good one, but if something goes wrong (damage, injury, or they simply stop showing up), you have little recourse.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How much can I save with recurring service?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Recurring customers typically save 10-20% compared to one-time pricing. For a 3-bedroom home on bi-weekly service, that's roughly $15-25 per visit. Over a year, the savings add up to $400-650.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I hire an independent cleaner or a company?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Independent cleaners cost less but often lack insurance and reliability guarantees. Professional companies cost 10-20% more but provide liability protection, backup staff, and accountability. For most Athens homeowners, the extra cost is worth the peace of mind.
