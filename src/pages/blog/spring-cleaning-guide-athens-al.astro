            <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Spring cleaning in Athens should happen mid-March to early April—after pollen peaks but before Alabama's summer humidity arrives. A thorough spring clean includes deep cleaning all rooms, washing windows, cleaning ceiling fans and vents, tackling baseboards, and removing winter's accumulated dust and allergens. Professional spring cleaning in Athens costs $200-$325 for a typical home.

          Spring in Athens means azaleas blooming around the courthouse square, perfect weather for enjoying the Big Spring Memorial Park—and yellow pollen coating everything. It's time to shake off winter and give your home a thorough refresh.

          For Athens families—many commuting to Huntsville or Decatur for work—weekends are precious. This guide helps you tackle spring cleaning efficiently, whether you're doing it yourself or hiring help.

        <!-- WHY SPRING CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Spring Cleaning Matters in Athens</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Spring cleaning serves practical purposes beyond tradition, especially in North Alabama:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Pollen control:</strong> Limestone County gets the same heavy pollen as the rest of North Alabama. That yellow dust infiltrates homes through doors, windows, HVAC systems, and on clothes and pets.</li>
          <li><strong>Rural dust:</strong> Many Athens-area homes are on larger lots or near farmland. Dust from gravel drives and agricultural activity adds to what accumulates inside.</li>
          <li><strong>Winter buildup:</strong> Homes stay sealed during cooler months, trapping dust, pet dander, and stale air. Spring cleaning clears what accumulated.</li>
          <li><strong>Humidity preparation:</strong> Alabama summers bring serious humidity. Deep cleaning now prevents moisture from combining with dust to create musty conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Pest prevention:</strong> Thorough spring cleaning removes crumbs and debris that attract ants and pests as temperatures rise.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- TIMING -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Best Time for Spring Cleaning in Athens</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Optimal window: Mid-March to early April.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Wait until pollen counts drop from "extreme" to "moderate"—typically late March in Limestone County. But don't wait too long; once May humidity arrives, deep cleaning becomes more challenging.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Athens Spring Cleaning Timeline</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Late February - Early March:</strong> Plan, declutter, schedule professional help if needed</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-March - Early April:</strong> Prime deep cleaning window</li>
            <li><strong>Late April:</strong> Last chance before humidity climbs</li>
            <li><strong>May onward:</strong> Transition to maintenance cleaning</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Booking tip:</strong> If hiring a cleaning service, book 2-3 weeks ahead. Spring is the busiest season, and services covering Limestone County fill up quickly.

            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">🌸 Pollen Management</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Upgrade HVAC filters during pollen season. Keep windows closed during peak pollen hours (usually mornings). Wipe down surfaces more frequently during the worst weeks. Consider a doormat and shoe removal policy.</p>
