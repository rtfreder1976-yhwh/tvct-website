            <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Spring cleaning in Birmingham should happen mid-March to early April—after pollen peaks but before summer humidity. A thorough spring clean includes deep cleaning all rooms, washing windows, cleaning ceiling fans and vents, tackling baseboards, and removing accumulated allergens. Professional spring cleaning in Birmingham costs $225-$400 for a typical home, with larger homes in Mountain Brook and Vestavia running higher.

        <!-- WHY SPRING CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Spring Cleaning Matters in Birmingham</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Spring cleaning isn't just tradition—it addresses real issues in our climate:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Heavy pollen:</strong> Birmingham's tree pollen season is intense, typically peaking late March into April. All that yellow dust infiltrates homes through every opening—doors, windows, HVAC, on clothes and pets.</li>
          <li><strong>Winter accumulation:</strong> Homes stay sealed during cooler months, trapping dust, pet dander, and stale air. Spring cleaning clears what built up.</li>
          <li><strong>Humidity preparation:</strong> Alabama summers bring serious humidity. Deep cleaning now prevents moisture from combining with dust to create musty conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Older home considerations:</strong> Birmingham has many beautiful older homes in Homewood, Mountain Brook, and Crestwood. These often need extra attention to window tracks, baseboards, and areas where dust accumulates.</li>
          <li><strong>Allergy relief:</strong> Deep cleaning removes accumulated allergens, providing relief as outdoor pollen counts rise.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- TIMING -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Best Time for Spring Cleaning in Birmingham</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Optimal window: Mid-March to early April.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Monitor Birmingham pollen forecasts—once counts drop from "extremely high" to "moderate," it's time. Clean too early and you'll just accumulate more pollen; wait too long and humidity makes everything harder.
        </p>

          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Birmingham Spring Cleaning Timeline</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Late February - Early March:</strong> Plan and declutter, schedule professional help (book early!)</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-March - Early April:</strong> Prime deep cleaning window</li>
            <li><strong>Late April:</strong> Final window before humidity climbs</li>
            <li><strong>May onward:</strong> Transition to regular maintenance</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-0">
            <strong>Birmingham Pro Tip:</strong> Spring is the busiest season for cleaning companies across the metro. If you want professional help—especially on weekends—book 2-3 weeks ahead. Premium neighborhoods like Mountain Brook book up particularly fast.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Spring Cleaning by Birmingham Neighborhood</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Different Birmingham areas have different considerations:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6 mb-8">
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Mountain Brook & Vestavia Hills</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Larger homes mean more time and attention needed. Many have multiple ceiling fans, extensive window coverage, and premium finishes requiring careful cleaning. Budget 6-10 hours for professional deep cleaning of larger properties. Consider quarterly deep cleans rather than just annual.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Homewood & Crestwood</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Beautiful older homes with character—and extra cleaning considerations. Pay attention to window tracks and original wood trim that collects dust. Check for any moisture issues in older construction. Historic charm requires gentle but thorough cleaning.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Downtown & Southside</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Lofts and condos have smaller square footage but may have extra-high ceilings and large industrial windows. Urban dust and traffic pollution add to cleaning needs. Good building air filtration helps, but spring cleaning is still essential.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Hoover & Trussville</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Mix of established neighborhoods and newer construction. New builds may still be off-gassing and accumulating construction dust. Established areas deal with mature tree pollen. Standard spring cleaning protocols apply.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- DIY VS PROFESSIONAL -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">DIY vs. Professional Spring Cleaning</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3"><strong>Best for:</strong> Smaller homes, those with time and physical ability</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600"><strong>Challenges:</strong> High ceilings, heavy furniture, specialized cleaning for premium finishes</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-[#FFA985]/10 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Professional Spring Cleaning</h4>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3"><strong>Best for:</strong> Larger homes, busy professionals, premium properties</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600"><strong>Advantages:</strong> Commercial equipment, trained staff, thorough results, insurance protection</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          For Birmingham's larger homes—particularly in Mountain Brook, Vestavia Hills, and Homewood—professional spring cleaning often makes the most sense. The time investment for DIY becomes significant, and the quality difference with professional equipment and techniques is notable.
