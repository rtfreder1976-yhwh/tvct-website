          You want a straight answer. How much does it actually cost to have someone clean your house in Alabama?

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          We're going to give you real numbers. Not vague ranges. Not "it depends" without context. Actual pricing based on what we charge and what we see in the market across Huntsville, Birmingham, and Middle Tennessee.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 font-medium mb-0">
            <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> For a standard 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home in Alabama, expect to pay $125-$200 for regular cleaning, $200-$350 for deep cleaning, and $250-$400 for move-out cleaning.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Now let's break down exactly what affects that price.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Four Factors That Determine Your Price</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">1. Type of Cleaning Service</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          This is the biggest factor. Different services require different amounts of time, effort, and expertise.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Standard/Regular Cleaning</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Price Range:</strong> $125 - $200 per visit</p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            This is maintenance cleaning for homes that are already in decent shape. Dusting, vacuuming, mopping, bathroom cleaning, kitchen cleaning. The basics done well.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            <strong>Best for:</strong> Recurring weekly or bi-weekly service to maintain a clean home.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Deep Cleaning</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Price Range:</strong> $200 - $400+ per visit</p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Everything in regular cleaning plus: inside appliances, baseboards, ceiling fans, behind furniture, window tracks, grout scrubbing, cabinet exteriors. This is the reset button for your home.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            <strong>Best for:</strong> First-time cleanings, seasonal deep cleans, pre-event preparation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Move-Out Cleaning</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Price Range:</strong> $250 - $450+ per visit</p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Deep cleaning plus: inside all cabinets and drawers, inside oven and refrigerator, window cleaning, light fixtures. The goal is to get your deposit back or prepare for new tenants.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            <strong>Best for:</strong> Renters moving out, landlords between tenants, sellers preparing for showing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Post-Construction Cleaning</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Price Range:</strong> $400 - $800+ per job</p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            This is specialized work. Construction dust gets everywhere—inside cabinets, in HVAC vents, on every surface. Requires multiple passes, specialized equipment, and more time than any other cleaning type.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
            <strong>Best for:</strong> New construction, major renovations, additions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">2. Home Size</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Bigger homes take more time. Simple math. Here's roughly how home size affects pricing for regular cleaning in Alabama:
        </p>

        <div class="overflow-x-auto mb-8">
          <table class="w-full text-left border-collapse">
            <thead>
              <tr class="bg-gray-100">
                <th class="p-4 border border-gray-200 font-bold">Home Size</th>

          </table>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">3. Current Condition</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          A home that's been maintained weekly cleans faster than one that hasn't been touched in six months. If your home needs significant catch-up work, expect a higher first-time cleaning cost.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Be honest when getting quotes. Cleaners can tell within minutes if the home condition was misrepresented. It's better to be upfront about the situation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">4. Location in Alabama</h3>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Prices vary somewhat by market. Here's what we see across our service areas:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Huntsville/Madison County:</strong> Slightly higher due to cost of living and demand from aerospace/tech professionals</li>
          <li><strong>Birmingham/Mountain Brook:</strong> Similar to Huntsville, with premium pricing in affluent areas like Mountain Brook</li>
          <li><strong>Florence/Muscle Shoals:</strong> Generally 10-15% lower than Huntsville</li>
          <li><strong>Nashville (our TN market):</strong> Highest prices due to Metro Nashville cost of living</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Recurring Service Discounts</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Most cleaning companies (including us) offer discounts for recurring service. Here's the typical structure:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Weekly service:</strong> 15-20% discount off one-time pricing</li>
          <li><strong>Bi-weekly service:</strong> 10-15% discount</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly service:</strong> 5-10% discount</li>
          <li><strong>One-time service:</strong> Full price</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The discount makes sense for both parties. Recurring clients are predictable revenue. Their homes stay cleaner between visits, so each cleaning takes less time. It's a win-win.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Red Flags: Prices That Are Too Low</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If someone quotes you $49 to clean your 3-bedroom house, run.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's the math: A thorough cleaning takes 2-4 hours minimum. At $49, that's $12-25 per hour—before supplies, insurance, travel time, and overhead. Nobody good works for that little.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Suspiciously low prices mean:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>They'll rush through in 45 minutes and call it done</li>
          <li>They don't carry insurance (huge liability for you)</li>
          <li>They're cutting corners on quality products</li>
          <li>They won't be in business long</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What You're Actually Paying For</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          When you hire a professional cleaning service, you're not just paying for labor. You're paying for:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Professional-grade products</strong> that actually work</li>
          <li><strong>Liability insurance</strong> ($2M in our case) to protect your property</li>
          <li><strong>Background-checked employees</strong> you can trust in your home</li>
          <li><strong>Training and quality systems</strong> that ensure consistent results</li>
          <li><strong>Time</strong>—yours, to spend on what actually matters to you</li>
          <li><strong>Peace of mind</strong> knowing the job is done right</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Our Pricing at The Valley Clean Team</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          We believe in transparency. Here's what we typically charge across Alabama and Middle Tennessee:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-[#FFA985]/10 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-0">
            <li><strong>Regular Cleaning:</strong> Starting at $125</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Cleaning:</strong> Starting at $200</li>
            <li><strong>Move-Out Cleaning:</strong> Starting at $250</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Construction:</strong> Starting at $400</li>
            <li><strong>Airbnb Turnover:</strong> Starting at $100</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Your actual quote depends on your specific home—size, condition, what you need done. But these starting points give you a realistic expectation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Is It Worth It?</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          That's a question only you can answer. But here's how to think about it:
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          If cleaning a 3-bedroom home takes you 4 hours and costs you $150 to outsource, you're essentially paying $37.50 per hour to get those 4 hours back.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          What would you do with those 4 hours? More billable work? Time with family? Rest? Exercise? A hobby you've neglected?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          For many people—especially busy professionals, families with young kids, or anyone dealing with health issues—that $37.50/hour is one of the best investments they can make.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          For others, it's a luxury that doesn't make sense right now. Both answers are valid.
        </p>
