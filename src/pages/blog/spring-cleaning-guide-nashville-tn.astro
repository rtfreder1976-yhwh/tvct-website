            <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Spring cleaning in Nashville should happen mid-March to early April—after pollen peaks but before summer humidity. A thorough spring clean covers deep cleaning all rooms, washing windows, cleaning ceiling fans and vents, tackling baseboards, and removing allergens. Professional spring cleaning in Nashville costs $250-$450 for a typical home, with larger Belle Meade and Franklin homes running higher.

        <!-- WHY SPRING CLEANING MATTERS -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Spring Cleaning Matters in Nashville</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Spring cleaning serves real purposes in Middle Tennessee:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Serious pollen:</strong> Nashville's tree pollen season is intense, typically peaking late March into April. All that yellow-green dust infiltrates homes through every opening—and Nashville's rapid growth hasn't helped air quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Construction dust:</strong> With cranes on every corner, Nashville's building boom means additional dust from nearby construction sites infiltrating homes and condos.</li>
          <li><strong>Winter accumulation:</strong> Homes stay sealed during cooler months, trapping dust, pet dander, and stale air.</li>
          <li><strong>Humidity prep:</strong> Tennessee summers bring humidity. Deep cleaning now prevents moisture from combining with dust to create musty conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>New transplants:</strong> If you're one of the many newcomers to Nashville, spring cleaning helps you truly settle into your space and address any issues from previous occupants.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- TIMING -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Best Time for Spring Cleaning in Nashville</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Optimal window: Mid-March to early April.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Check Nashville pollen forecasts and wait until counts drop from "very high" to "moderate." This typically happens late March, though it varies by year. Clean too early and you'll just re-accumulate pollen; wait too long and humidity makes everything harder.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Nashville Spring Cleaning Timeline</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Late February - Early March:</strong> Plan, declutter, book professional services (they fill fast!)</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-March - Early April:</strong> Prime deep cleaning window</li>
            <li><strong>Late April:</strong> Last chance before humidity and heat arrive</li>
            <li><strong>May onward:</strong> Transition to regular maintenance</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-[#FFA985]/10 border-l-4 border-[#FFA985] p-6 mb-8 rounded-r-lg">
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-0">
            <strong>Nashville Reality Check:</strong> Demand for cleaning services far exceeds supply here. Book 3-4 weeks ahead for spring cleaning—especially for weekend appointments or premium neighborhoods. Last-minute availability is rare.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Nashville's massive short-term rental market means many hosts need to think about spring cleaning differently:

          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Airbnb Spring Cleaning Strategy</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Block 1-2 days:</strong> Schedule a gap in bookings during the March-April window specifically for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li><strong>Beyond turnover cleaning:</strong> Spring cleaning is more intensive than your regular turnover service. It addresses annual maintenance tasks that quick turnovers can't cover.</li>
            <li><strong>Mattress attention:</strong> Flip/rotate mattresses, vacuum thoroughly, consider mattress protector replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>Soft goods refresh:</strong> Assess pillows, throws, and linens for replacement. Spring is a good time to refresh these items.</li>
            <li><strong>Check everything:</strong> Test all appliances, check for maintenance issues, replace batteries in smoke detectors, verify all amenities work.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo readiness:</strong> A spring-cleaned property photographs better. Consider updated listing photos after your deep clean.</li>

        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Cost for Airbnb spring cleaning:</strong> Expect $200-$400 depending on property size—more than turnover cleaning but covering tasks that improve guest experience and protect your investment.

            <p class="text-gray-600">Larger homes (often 4,000-8,000+ sq ft) require significant time investment. Many have extensive window coverage, multiple ceiling fans, and premium finishes. Budget 6-12 hours for professional deep cleaning. High-end finishes may need specialized attention.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>The Nashville math:</strong> If deep cleaning takes 20 hours DIY and costs $350 to outsource, you're paying $17.50/hour to reclaim that time. Given Nashville's high-earning professional population, that's often a clear win—especially when you factor in quality of results.

              Block 1-2 days during March or early April for a deep clean beyond your regular turnover service. This addresses annual maintenance, refreshes soft goods, and ensures your property is in top shape for the busy season. Budget $200-$400 depending on property size.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Look for liability insurance ($2M recommended), bonding, background-checked employees, and strong recent reviews. Nashville's growth means many new operators—verify credentials and check reviews from the past 6-12 months specifically.
