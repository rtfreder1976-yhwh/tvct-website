        <!-- WHY MEDICAL OFFICES ARE DIFFERENT -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Medical Office Cleaning Is Different</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Medical office cleaning isn't just commercial cleaning with different products. Healthcare environments have unique requirements:

          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Healthcare Cleaning Requirements</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>Infection control protocols:</strong> CDC guidelines for environmental infection control require specific procedures for exam rooms, procedure areas, and common spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>EPA-registered disinfectants:</strong> Healthcare facilities need hospital-grade disinfectants proven effective against HAIs (healthcare-associated infections).</li>
            <li><strong>Contact time compliance:</strong> Disinfectants only work when left wet for their specified "dwell time"—rushed cleaning defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>High-touch surface focus:</strong> Door handles, light switches, counter edges, and equipment surfaces require attention commercial cleaners often miss.</li>
            <li><strong>HIPAA awareness:</strong> Cleaners work around patient information and must understand confidentiality requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>After-hours service:</strong> Most medical practices need cleaning outside patient hours.</li>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Medical office cleaning in Birmingham typically costs $175-$400+ per visit, or $0.15-$0.25 per square foot. A 2,000 sq ft practice cleaned 3x weekly runs $600-$1,200/month. Pricing depends on exam room count, procedure areas, specialty, and location.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              While cleaning companies aren't "covered entities" under HIPAA, responsible medical office cleaners should have HIPAA awareness training. This includes understanding patient privacy, proper document handling, and confidentiality requirements. Quality services operate with HIPAA awareness to protect your practice.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Most Birmingham medical practices need professional cleaning 3-5 times per week. High-volume practices and urgent care centers often need daily service. The CDC recommends daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces in healthcare settings. Low-volume specialty practices may manage with 2-3 times weekly.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Medical offices require EPA-registered hospital-grade disinfectants effective against healthcare-associated pathogens including MRSA, C. diff, norovirus, and influenza. Look for EPA List N disinfectants which meet efficacy standards. Proper contact time is critical—the disinfectant must remain wet for its specified dwell time to be effective.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Should we use the same cleaning team each visit?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Yes, consistent staffing is especially important for medical facilities. The same team learns your protocols, layout, and specific requirements. Staff familiarity also matters for security—you want to know who's in your practice around patient information and medical equipment. Avoid services that rotate random workers.
