# Deep Clean vs. Regular Clean: Which One Is For You?

It's the most common question we get at **The Valley Clean Team**: *"I just need my house cleaned... do I book a standard clean or a deep clean?"*

It makes sense. To the untrained eye, "clean is clean." But in the professional world, the difference between these two services is the difference between specific maintenance and a total reset.

Think of it like car maintenance: **Regular Cleaning** is your basic car wash and vacuum. **Deep Cleaning** is the full detailing service where they remove the seats and polish the engine block.

## What is a Regular Clean? (The "Maintenance" Clean)

A Regular Clean (often called "Maintenance Cleaning" or "Maid Service") is designed to keep your home consistently fresh. It assumes the home has already been deep cleaned recently.

**Goal**: Maintain a baseline level of cleanliness.

### What's Typically Included:
*   **Floors**: Vacuuming carpets and mopping hard floors.
*   **Kitchen**: Wiping down countertops, stovetop, and exterior of appliances.
*   **Bathrooms**: Sanitizing toilets, sinks, showers, and mirrors.
*   **Living Areas**: Dusting visible surfaces, tidying up.
*   **Dusting**: Light dusting of furniture and ledges.

**Best For**:
*   Recurring weekly or bi-weekly clients.
*   Homes that are already relatively tidy.
*   People who want to "maintain" rather than "restore."

## What is a Deep Clean? (The "Reset" Clean)

A Deep Clean is a comprehensive, top-to-bottom scrub. It attacks the built-up grime that regular cleaning doesn't touch. We recommend every new client starts here.

**Goal**: Restore the home to "like-new" condition.

### The Deep Clean Difference (What You Get Extra):
*   **Baseboards**: Hand-washed (not just dusted).
*   **Doors & Frames**: Scrubbed for fingerprints and scuffs.
*   **Light Fixtures & Fans**: Thoroughly cleaned (glass globes removed if necessary).
*   **Blinds**: Individually hand-wiped.
*   **Kitchen**: Inside the microwave, deep scrub of drip pans, and cabinet fronts detailed.
*   **Bathrooms**: Heavy-duty grout scrubbing and descaling of shower heads.
*   **Vents**: Vacuumed and wiped.

**Best For**:
*   First-time customers (Initial Clean).
*   Spring Cleaning (once or twice a year).
*   Homes that haven't been professionally cleaned in 3+ months.
*   Before hosting a major event.

## Comparison at a Glance

| Feature | Regular Clean | Deep Clean |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time Required** | 2-3 Hours | 5-8 Hours |
| **Focus** | Surface Dirt | Hidden Grime |
| **Baseboards** | Dusted | Hand-Washed |
| **Cost** | $$ | $$$$ |
| **Frequency** | Weekly/Bi-Weekly | Monthly/Quarterly/Annually |

## Why Can't I Just Start with a Regular Clean?

Many customers ask, *"Can't you just come and do a regular clean first?"*

Imagine a dentist. You can't just go in for a quick polish if you have 10 years of plaque buildup. You need a "deep cleaning" (scaling) first to get the teeth healthy enough for regular maintenance.

The same applies to your home. If we only dust the surface of a home that hasn't been deep cleaned, the dust from the ceiling fans, blinds, and baseboards will quickly circulate back onto the surfaces we just cleaned. The "Deep Clean" sets the baseline so our "Regular Cleans" can be effective.

## Real-World Cost Difference

At **The Valley Clean Team**, we believe in transparent pricing.

*   **Regular Cleaning**: Typically starts around **$125 - $175** per visit for average homes.
*   **Deep Cleaning**: Typically ranges from **$350 - $600+** depending on the size and condition of the home.

*Note: You can check our [Pricing Page](/pricing) for exact estimates.*

## Verdict: Which Do You Need?

**Choose a Deep Clean if:**
*   It's your first time hiring us.
*   You're prepping for the holidays.
*   You notice dust sticking to your baseboards or vents.
*   Your bathroom grout has changed color.

**Choose a Regular Clean if:**
*   You've had a deep clean in the last month.
*   You want to free up your weekends permanently.
*   You need help "keeping up" with daily messes.
