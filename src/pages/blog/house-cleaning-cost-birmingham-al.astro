        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Understanding the Birmingham Cleaning Market</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Birmingham's cleaning market</strong> is diverse. You'll find national franchises, regional companies, local independents, and gig economy apps all competing for business. Prices vary significantly depending on who you hire and where you live.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The Birmingham market is also segmented by neighborhood. Mountain Brook and Vestavia Hills have different expectations (and home sizes) than Irondale or Trussville. Understanding this helps you evaluate whether a quote is reasonable for your area.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How much can I save with recurring service?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Recurring customers save 10-20% compared to one-time pricing. For a 3-bedroom home on bi-weekly service, that's roughly $15-30 per visit. Over a year, savings add up to $400-800.

              Essential: liability insurance ($1M minimum, $2M preferred for larger homes), bonding, background-checked employees, and clear written pricing. Check Google reviews specifically from your area—a company can have mixed results across a metro this size.
