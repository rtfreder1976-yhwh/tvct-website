                    hours to spend scrubbing floors. You need a cleaning service
                    that shows up on time, does the job right, and respects your
                    home.

                    1. Verify Insurance Limits

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    Given the property values in neighborhoods like Clifts Cove,
                    ensure your cleaner carries at least $1M in liability

                    Does the company hire W-2 employees or 1099 contractors? W-2
                    employees are typically better trained, background checked,
                    and covered by workers' comp. Contractors may be less
                    vetted.

                    3. Read Recent Reviews
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    Look for reviews from the last 3-6 months. A company that
                    was good two years ago might have changed management.
