        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What Is Professional House Cleaning?</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Professional house cleaning</strong> is a service where trained cleaning specialists clean your home using commercial-grade equipment and products. Unlike DIY cleaning, professional services follow systematic processes to ensure consistent results, and reputable companies carry insurance to protect your home and belongings.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Professional cleaning typically includes dusting, vacuuming, mopping, bathroom sanitization, and kitchen cleaning. Deep cleaning services add more intensive tasks like inside appliances, baseboards, and window tracks.
        </p>

        <!-- LOCAL CONTEXT -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Florence Residents Choose Local Cleaning Services</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Florence is a tight-knit community in the Shoals region, with a mix of historic homes near downtown, established neighborhoods in the Killen area, and newer construction throughout Lauderdale County. Local cleaning companies understand the specific needs here—from the red clay soil that tracks through entryways to the humidity levels that require attention to bathroom ventilation and mold prevention.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Hiring locally also means faster response times and accountability within your own community. When something goes wrong (and eventually, something always does), you want a company that will make it right because their reputation depends on it.
        </p>

        <!-- HOW-TO SECTION - AEO Magnet -->
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">How to Choose a Cleaning Company in Florence: 5 Steps</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Selecting the right cleaning service protects both your home and your peace of mind. Follow these steps to make a confident decision:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Verify Insurance and Bonding</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Before allowing anyone into your home, confirm the company carries liability insurance and is bonded. This protects you if accidents happen—a broken vase, a scratched floor, or worse. <strong>Ask directly:</strong> "Can you provide proof of insurance?" Any legitimate company will have this ready.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Read Local Reviews (Not Just Star Ratings)</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Look for reviews on Google and Facebook from people in Florence specifically. Pay attention to comments about reliability, communication, and whether the same cleaners come each visit. A company can have 5 stars but still not be the right fit if reviewers mention issues that matter to you.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Ask About Their Cleaning Process</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Professional companies should be able to explain exactly what's included in their service. Vague answers like "we clean everything" are a red flag. Request a written checklist so you know what to expect and can hold them accountable.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Get Pricing in Writing</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Reputable cleaners provide clear quotes before the job. Be cautious of companies that won't give estimates or add surprise charges after. Standard house cleaning in Florence typically ranges from $125-$250 depending on home size.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Start with a Single Cleaning</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Before committing to a recurring plan, book a one-time cleaning to test the service. This lets you evaluate their work without a long-term commitment. Any company confident in their quality will be happy to earn your recurring business this way.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-[#FFA985]/10 border-l-4 border-[#FFA985] p-6 mb-8 rounded-r-lg">
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-0">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The Valley Clean Team offers a satisfaction guarantee on every cleaning—if you're not happy, they'll make it right. That removes the risk from trying a new service.

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How much does house cleaning cost in Florence, AL?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              House cleaning in Florence typically costs between $125 and $300, depending on home size and service type. Standard cleaning for an average 3-bedroom home starts around $125-$175, while deep cleaning runs $200-$300. Most companies offer discounts for recurring service—typically 10-20% off for weekly or bi-weekly plans.
            </p>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How often should I have my house professionally cleaned?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Most families benefit from bi-weekly professional cleaning, which maintains cleanliness without excessive cost. Homes with pets, children, or high traffic may need weekly service, while singles or couples often find monthly cleaning sufficient. The right frequency depends on your lifestyle and budget.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the difference between standard cleaning and deep cleaning?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Standard cleaning covers regular maintenance: vacuuming, mopping, bathroom sanitizing, dusting, and kitchen cleaning. Deep cleaning adds intensive tasks like inside appliances, baseboards, window tracks, ceiling fans, and detailed scrubbing. Deep cleaning is typically needed seasonally, before special events, or as a first-time cleaning before starting recurring service.

          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Are cleaning companies in Florence, AL insured?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Reputable cleaning companies carry liability insurance and are bonded to protect homeowners. Always ask for proof before booking—legitimate companies will provide this without hesitation. The Valley Clean Team carries $2M in liability coverage that protects your home and belongings.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              That's entirely your preference. Many clients provide a door code or spare key and aren't home during cleanings—it's often easier to clean an empty house anyway. Trustworthy companies conduct background checks on all staff. If you prefer to be present for your first cleaning to see how things go, that's completely reasonable.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Most professional cleaning companies bring their own supplies and equipment. This includes vacuums, mops, and cleaning products. If you have specific preferences—like eco-friendly products or certain brands—ask if the company can accommodate. The Valley Clean Team brings all supplies and uses professional-grade products.
