          Why Nashville Cleaning Costs More
        </h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>Nashville's economy</strong> has been on fire for over a decade.
          Healthcare giants, tech companies, and the entertainment industry have brought
          high-paying jobs—and high-spending residents. The cost of living has skyrocketed,
          and service businesses have adjusted accordingly.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The short-term rental boom has also impacted the cleaning market.
          Thousands of Airbnb and VRBO properties compete for reliable turnover
          cleaning, creating additional demand and pushing prices up for
          everyone.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Here's how Nashville compares to other markets we serve:

              Standard house cleaning in Nashville costs $150-$225 for a typical
              3-bedroom home. Deep cleaning runs $250-$400, and move-out

              Why is house cleaning more expensive in Nashville?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Nashville's explosive growth, booming economy, and elevated cost
              of living have pushed all service prices up. Demand for quality
              cleaning far exceeds supply. The city's thousands of short-term
              rentals also compete for cleaning services.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Airbnb turnover cleaning in Nashville costs $100-$225 depending on
              property size. A standard 2-bedroom typically runs $125-$165. This
              includes full cleaning, linen changes, restocking, and ensuring
              guest-ready presentation.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Recurring customers save 10-20% versus one-time pricing. For a
              3-bedroom Nashville home on bi-weekly service, that's $20-35 per
              visit. Over a year, savings add up to $500-900—significant in this
              higher-priced market.

              Prices vary primarily based on home size and travel distance.
              Belle Meade and Franklin homes tend to be larger, resulting in
              higher quotes. Downtown condos and East Nashville smaller homes
              cost less. The rate per square foot is fairly consistent.
