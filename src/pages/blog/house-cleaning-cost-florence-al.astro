        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
          What Determines Cleaning Prices in Florence?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <strong>House cleaning pricing</strong> is based on several factors: the
          size of your home, the type of cleaning you need, the current condition,
          and how often you want service. Understanding these factors helps you know
          if you're getting a fair quote.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Florence and the Shoals area (including Muscle Shoals, Sheffield, and
          Tuscumbia) have slightly lower prices than Huntsville or Birmingham.
          That's a reflection of the local cost of living, not a difference in
          quality. Reputable companies maintain the same standards regardless of
          which market they serve.

          Suspiciously low prices typically mean: they'll rush through in 45
          minutes, they don't carry insurance (huge liability for you), they're
          cutting corners on products, or they won't be around next month.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">

              Why is house cleaning cheaper in Florence than Huntsville?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              The Shoals area has a lower cost of living than Huntsville, which
              affects service pricing across the board. This doesn't mean lower
              quality—reputable companies maintain the same standards in all
              markets they serve.

              How much do recurring cleaning services cost in Florence?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Recurring cleaning offers 10-20% savings over one-time pricing.
              For a 3-bedroom home in Florence: weekly service averages
              $100-$140/visit, bi-weekly runs $115-$160/visit, and monthly costs
              $120-$170/visit.

              What affects the price of house cleaning?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              The main factors are: home size (square footage and bedrooms),
              service type (standard vs. deep), current condition of the home,
              frequency of service, and any add-ons like inside refrigerator or
              oven cleaning.

              Is it cheaper to hire an independent cleaner?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-0">
              Independent cleaners may charge $20-40 less per cleaning, but many
              lack insurance and bonding. If they damage something or get
              injured in your home, you could be liable. Professional companies
              cost slightly more but provide protection, consistency, and
              reliability.
