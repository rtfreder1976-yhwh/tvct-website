// FAQ Schema - AEO optimized for luxury/historic searches
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What products do you use on hardwood floors?",
    answer: "We use pH-balanced, residue-free wood floor cleaners specifically formulated for hardwood. For original antique floors, we use even gentler products that clean without stripping decades-old patina or damaging historic finishes. We never use vinegar, ammonia, or steam on hardwood - all common DIY methods that can damage wood floors over time. Our products clean effectively while preserving and protecting your floors' natural beauty and finish."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean marble without damaging it?",
    answer: "Yes. Marble requires specific care because it's porous and sensitive to acidic cleaners. We use pH-neutral stone cleaners that safely clean marble without etching, dulling, or damaging the surface. We avoid all acidic products (vinegar, citrus, most bathroom cleaners) that can permanently damage marble. For marble countertops, floors, and bathroom surfaces, proper product selection is critical - we use professional-grade stone care products designed for this purpose."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have experience cleaning historic homes?",
    answer: "Yes. The Valley Clean Team has extensive experience cleaning historic properties in Florence's Walnut Street district, Mountain Brook's historic areas, and throughout our service area. Historic homes have unique needs: plaster walls instead of drywall, original hardwood that's irreplaceable, antique fixtures, vintage tile, and architectural details that require gentle, informed care. Our team is trained in preservation-safe methods and product selection appropriate for historic materials."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you protect antiques and valuables during cleaning?",
    answer: "We treat every valuable item with museum-quality care. Before cleaning, we note any antiques, art, or heirlooms that require special attention. We use lint-free microfiber cloths, appropriate cleaning solutions for each material, and careful handling techniques. We never move valuable items without permission. For irreplaceable pieces, we follow your specific instructions. Our $2 million insurance provides additional protection, but our careful handling means you rarely need it."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between regular and luxury home cleaning?",
    answer: "Luxury home cleaning goes beyond standard service in several ways: (1) Product selection - we use premium, material-appropriate cleaners for marble, granite, hardwood, and fine surfaces. (2) Attention to detail - we clean architectural features, moldings, and details standard cleaning skips. (3) Handling - we're trained to work around antiques, art, and high-value items safely. (4) Time - we don't rush, ensuring meticulous results. (5) Discretion - we understand privacy concerns in high-end homes."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean homes over 5,000 square feet?",
    answer: "Yes! Unlike some competitors who refuse large homes (Bear Brothers, for example, won't clean homes over 7,000 sq ft), The Valley Clean Team welcomes estates of any size. We've cleaned homes from 5,000 to over 15,000 square feet. We adjust team size and scheduling to match your property's needs. See our Estate Cleaning service for homes 4,000+ sq ft."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean granite countertops properly?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Granite requires specific care to maintain its beauty and seal. We use pH-neutral granite cleaners that won't break down the sealer or dull the finish. We avoid acidic cleaners, vinegar, and abrasive products. For daily cleaning, gentle soap and water works well, but our deep cleaning includes proper granite care that cleans without damage. We can also identify if your granite needs resealing (if water no longer beads on the surface)."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle crystal chandeliers and light fixtures?",
    answer: "For accessible chandeliers, we carefully dust or clean each crystal and the fixture frame using appropriate methods. We never spray cleaners directly onto electrical fixtures. For complex or very high chandeliers, we may recommend a specialty service. Our white glove cleaning service includes detailed light fixture cleaning as standard."
  },
  {
    question: "What about cleaning around fine art and collections?",
    answer: "We're extremely careful around fine art and collections. Generally, we dust frames only (not the art itself unless specifically instructed) using soft, lint-free cloths. We never use cleaning products near art. For valuable collections - whether wine, antiques, or other collectibles - we follow your specific guidance and treat items as irreplaceable. If you have concerns about specific pieces, we'll discuss handling before we begin."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer recurring service for luxury homes?",
    answer: "Yes, and recurring service is actually ideal for luxury homes. Regular professional maintenance protects your investment by preventing buildup that can damage fine finishes. We offer weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly service with the same dedicated team every visit. Your team learns your home's specific needs, your preferences, and provides consistent care that maintains your home's beauty and value."
