// FAQ Schema
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How long does a deep cleaning take?",
    answer: "A typical deep cleaning takes 3-6 hours depending on your home's size and condition. A 2,000 sq ft home usually takes 4-5 hours. Larger homes or homes that haven't been professionally cleaned in a while may take longer. We'll provide a time estimate when you book."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does deep cleaning cost?",
    answer: "Deep cleaning starts at $175 for smaller homes. Average pricing is $250-$400 for a typical 3-bedroom home. Factors that affect pricing include home size, number of bathrooms, current condition, and any special requests. We provide free, no-obligation quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between deep cleaning and regular cleaning?",
    answer: "Regular cleaning maintains cleanliness with surface-level tasks like vacuuming, mopping, and wiping counters. Deep cleaning is a comprehensive, top-to-bottom clean that tackles built-up grime, neglected areas, and hard-to-reach spots like inside cabinets, behind appliances, baseboards, ceiling fans, and window tracks. We recommend a deep clean first, then regular maintenance cleanings."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I get a deep cleaning?",
    answer: "We recommend a deep cleaning every 3-6 months, depending on your household. Homes with pets, children, or allergy sufferers benefit from quarterly deep cleans. Many clients start with a deep clean and then switch to weekly or bi-weekly regular cleanings to maintain that fresh feeling."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be home during the deep cleaning?",
    answer: "No, you don't need to be home. Many clients provide a key, garage code, or smart lock access. We're fully insured and bonded, and all team members are background checked. If you prefer to be home, that's perfectly fine too!"
  },
  {
    question: "Do you bring your own supplies and equipment?",
    answer: "Yes! We bring all professional-grade cleaning supplies and equipment. Our products are effective yet safe for families and pets. If you have specific product preferences, allergies, or want us to use your own supplies, just let us know and we'll accommodate your needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you do a deep clean the same day?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer same-day deep cleaning service based on availability. For same-day requests, call us directly at 256-826-1100 as early as possible. We understand emergencies happen and do our best to accommodate urgent cleaning needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the deep cleaning?",
    answer: "Your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed. If you're not completely happy with any aspect of our deep cleaning, contact us within 24 hours and we'll return to re-clean those areas at no additional charge. That's our promise to you."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean inside the refrigerator and oven?",
    answer: "Inside refrigerator and oven cleaning are available as add-on services. Our standard deep clean includes wiping down the exterior of all appliances. Let us know if you'd like interior appliance cleaning added to your service."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your cleaners background checked?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Every member of The Valley Clean Team undergoes a thorough background check before joining our team. We're also fully insured with $2 million in liability coverage and bonded for your complete peace of mind."
