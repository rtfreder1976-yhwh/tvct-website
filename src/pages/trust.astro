  {
    question: "Is The Valley Clean Team safe to trust in my home?",
    answer: "Yes. The Valley Clean Team is a veteran-owned company built on trust and integrity. Every team member passes a comprehensive background check before ever entering a client's home. We carry $2 million in liability insurance to protect your property. All cleaners are bonded. We've completed over 1,000 cleanings with 130+ five-star reviews. Many clients trust us with house keys, alarm codes, and access while they're at work - that's the level of trust we've earned and take seriously."
  },
  {
    question: "How is The Valley Clean Team different from MaidPro?",
    answer: "Several key differences: (1) We send the same dedicated team to your home every visit - MaidPro and similar franchises often rotate crews, so you never know who's coming. (2) We're a local, veteran-owned business accountable to this community - not a franchise following corporate policies. (3) We don't charge cancellation fees when life happens. (4) Our pricing is transparent with no hidden upsells. (5) We carry $2 million in insurance vs industry-standard $1 million. (6) Owner involvement - you can reach the owners directly, not a call center."
  },
  {
    question: "Do your cleaners pass background checks?",
    answer: "Yes, every Valley Clean Team member passes a comprehensive background check before joining our team. This includes criminal history, identity verification, and reference checks. We also verify work eligibility. We understand you're trusting strangers in your home around your family, your belongings, and sometimes your pets - we take that responsibility seriously and only hire people we'd trust in our own homes."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your cleaners W-2 employees or independent contractors?",
    answer: "Our core team members are employees, not gig workers from an app. This matters because: (1) We train them directly in our methods and standards. (2) We're responsible for their work quality. (3) They're covered by our insurance and workers' compensation. (4) They receive consistent work and fair treatment, which means they stay longer and do better work. (5) You get the same team who knows your home, not random contractors."
  },
  {
    question: "What insurance does The Valley Clean Team carry?",
    answer: "We carry $2 million in general liability insurance - double the industry standard of $1 million. This protects your home and belongings in the rare event something is damaged. All team members are bonded. We also carry workers' compensation insurance, which protects you from liability if a worker is injured on your property. We're happy to provide certificates of insurance upon request."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I trust cleaners with my house keys?",
    answer: "Many of our clients trust us with keys, garage codes, or alarm access so we can clean while they're at work. We've earned this trust through consistent, honest service over years. Keys are secured in a locked system accessible only to your assigned team. We never share access information, and our background-checked team treats your home's security as seriously as we treat our own. References available upon request."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean homes with children and babies?",
    answer: "Absolutely, and safety is paramount. We use eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning products that are safe for children, babies, and pregnant women. Our team is trained to be aware of child safety concerns - we're careful with cleaning supplies, we don't leave hazards, and we're gentle around nurseries and play areas. Many of our team members are parents themselves who understand these concerns firsthand."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean homes with pets?",
    answer: "Yes! We're pet-friendly and most of our cleaners are animal lovers. We use pet-safe cleaning products and are careful around pet areas, beds, and supplies. We know pets are family. If your pet is anxious around strangers, just let us know and we'll work with you on a plan - whether that's keeping them in a specific room or adjusting our approach."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if something is damaged or broken?",
    answer: "Accidents are rare, but we own them when they happen. If something is damaged during cleaning, report it within 24 hours and we'll make it right - either through repair, replacement, or our insurance. We don't hide behind fine print or blame clients. Our $2 million liability coverage exists specifically for these situations. Your trust matters more than avoiding a claim."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is The Valley Clean Team veteran-owned?",
    answer: "The Valley Clean Team was founded by Todd Frederickson, a veteran who brings military values to our business: integrity, attention to detail, reliability, and doing the right thing even when no one's watching. These aren't marketing buzzwords - they're how we operate. When we say we'll be there at 9am, we're there. When we say something is included, it's included. When we make a mistake, we own it. That's what veteran-owned means to us."
