    question: "Do you guarantee I will get my security deposit back?",
    answer:
      "While we can't legally guarantee your landlord's decision, The Valley Clean Team cleans to landlord inspection standards. We provide detailed before/after photos documenting our work. Our move-out clients have a 95%+ success rate getting full deposits back. If your landlord identifies specific cleaning issues after our service, contact us within 24 hours and we'll return to address them at no charge.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in move in/out cleaning?",
    answer:
      "Our move-out cleaning covers every surface landlords inspect: all floors (vacuumed, mopped, edges), baseboards, interior windows and tracks, all light fixtures, bathroom fixtures and grout, kitchen appliances inside and out (oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave), all cabinets and drawers inside and out, closet shelves and rods, and wall spot-cleaning for scuffs and marks.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does move in/out cleaning cost?",
    answer:
      "Move-out cleaning starts at $351 for homes up to 1,500 sq ft. Medium homes (1,500-2,500 sq ft) start at $456. Larger homes and properties needing extra attention are priced accordingly. We provide free, no-obligation quotes so you know the exact cost before booking.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does move-out cleaning take?",
    answer:
      "Typically 4-8 hours depending on home size and condition. A standard 3-bedroom, 2-bath home usually takes 5-6 hours. We don't rush - thorough cleaning protects your deposit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean before my landlord walkthrough?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We recommend booking 2-3 days before your walkthrough for optimal scheduling. Same-day service is available when our schedule permits. We can coordinate timing with your move-out date and inspection schedule.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean inside appliances?",
    answer:
      "Yes, appliance interiors are included standard in move-out cleaning. We clean inside the refrigerator (shelves, drawers, door compartments), oven interior and racks, dishwasher interior, and microwave. These are common inspection failure points that we address thoroughly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is The Valley Clean Team insured for move-out cleaning?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we carry $2 million in liability insurance. All team members are background-checked and bonded. This protects you during the move-out process when properties are often at their most vulnerable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work around my moving schedule?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We can clean before movers arrive, after they leave, or coordinate around your packing schedule. We're flexible because we understand move-out timelines are stressful and often change.",
