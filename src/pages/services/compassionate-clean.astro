const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Do you judge messy houses?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. The Valley Clean Team was founded on the belief that 'Life is messy. We've got this.' We understand that overwhelming messes happen to good people - depression, illness, caregiving responsibilities, demanding jobs, ADHD, grief, new babies, or simply life getting away from you. We've seen it all, we don't judge, and we're here to help without any shame or embarrassment. Our team is trained in compassionate service, not just cleaning."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with depression cleaning?",
    answer: "Yes. Depression can make even basic tasks feel impossible, and when cleaning falls behind, the mess itself can worsen depression - creating a painful cycle. We provide compassionate, non-judgmental cleaning that helps break that cycle. We work at your comfort level, respect your space and privacy, and understand that this isn't about laziness - it's about being human. Many clients tell us getting their home reset was a turning point in their mental health journey."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a 'home reset' cleaning?",
    answer: "A home reset is our compassionate deep cleaning service for homes that have become overwhelming. Unlike regular cleaning, we don't assume your home has been maintained - we start from wherever you are and transform your space into a fresh start. This includes decluttering assistance (with your guidance), deep cleaning all surfaces, organizing, and creating a clean foundation you can maintain. It's a judgment-free reset button for your home."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does compassionate cleaning cost?",
    answer: "Compassionate cleaning is quoted individually because every situation is different. We never charge by the hour for these jobs - you'll know your exact price upfront with no surprises. Generally, home reset cleanings range from $400-$1,200+ depending on home size and condition. We can also create payment plans if needed. The price you see is the price you pay."
  },
  {
    question: "Will you tell anyone about the condition of my home?",
    answer: "Never. Confidentiality is absolute. Our team signs confidentiality agreements, we arrive in unmarked vehicles upon request, and we never discuss client situations outside our team. Your privacy is protected. Many of our compassionate cleaning clients are professionals, parents, and people you'd never suspect struggle with home maintenance - and no one will ever know from us."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with hoarding situations?",
    answer: "We can help with cluttered and overwhelming homes, but clinical hoarding situations often require specialized support beyond cleaning. If your home has significant hoarding, we recommend connecting with a hoarding specialist or therapist first. We're happy to work alongside mental health professionals or after therapeutic intervention to help with the cleaning portion. For moderate clutter and overwhelm that doesn't rise to clinical hoarding, we're here to help."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help elderly people who can't keep up with cleaning?",
    answer: "Yes, and this is close to our hearts. Many elderly clients struggle to maintain their homes due to mobility issues, energy limitations, or simply aging. We provide compassionate, respectful service that helps seniors maintain dignity and independence in their homes. We work gently, communicate clearly, and treat your loved ones the way we'd want our own grandparents treated."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm embarrassed to let you in?",
    answer: "We understand, and you're not alone - embarrassment is the #1 reason people delay getting help. But please know: we've seen it all. Truly. Your home won't shock us or change how we treat you. Our team is specifically trained to be warm, non-judgmental, and discreet. Many clients cry with relief during or after our service - not because of the clean home, but because someone finally helped without making them feel worse. You deserve help without shame."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help after illness or surgery recovery?",
    answer: "Absolutely. When you're recovering from illness, surgery, or medical treatment, cleaning is impossible and coming home to a messy house makes recovery harder. We provide pre-surgery preparation (so you come home to clean) and post-recovery cleanup. We work around your medical equipment, respect your physical limitations, and help create a clean, healing environment."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with ADHD clients?",
    answer: "Yes! ADHD can make home maintenance extraordinarily difficult, even when you desperately want a clean home. Executive function challenges, time blindness, and overwhelm paralysis are real - not character flaws. We provide the external support system that helps bridge the gap. Many of our recurring clients have ADHD and tell us our service gives them the 'reset' their brain needs to function better at home."
