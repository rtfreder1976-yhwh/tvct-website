// FAQ Schema
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What size home qualifies for estate cleaning service?",
    answer:
      "Our estate cleaning service is designed for homes 4,000 square feet and larger. This includes large single-family homes, multi-level estates, properties with guest houses or pool houses, and homes with extensive outdoor living spaces. There's no maximum size - we've successfully cleaned homes over 10,000 sq ft.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have a maximum home size you'll clean?",
    answer:
      "No. Unlike some competitors who refuse homes over 7,000 sq ft, The Valley Clean Team welcomes large estates of any size. We simply adjust our team size and scheduling to match your property's needs. No home is too large for our experienced estate cleaning teams.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I have the same cleaning team every visit?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Estate clients receive a dedicated team that cleans your property every visit. Your team learns your home's layout, your preferences, and any special requirements. This consistency ensures better results and builds the trust that comes from familiar faces caring for your home.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does estate cleaning pricing work?",
    answer:
      "Estate cleaning is custom-quoted based on your home's square footage, number of rooms, special features, and service frequency. We provide a detailed walkthrough and quote before starting. Most estate clients find recurring service (weekly or bi-weekly) offers the best value and keeps their home consistently maintained.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean guest houses, pool houses, and outbuildings?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Estate cleaning includes all structures on your property - main residence, guest quarters, pool houses, home offices, and detached structures. We create a comprehensive cleaning plan that addresses every building you want maintained.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you coordinate with our estate manager or household staff?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we regularly work with estate managers, personal assistants, and household staff. We can provide detailed reports, coordinate schedules around events, accommodate special requests, and integrate seamlessly with your existing household operations.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What's included in estate cleaning that other services don't offer?",
    answer:
      "Estate cleaning includes: dedicated team assignment, priority scheduling, seasonal deep cleans, coordination with household staff, detailed reporting upon request, flexible rescheduling without penalties, and a dedicated account manager who knows your property and preferences.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle valuable antiques and fine furnishings?",
    answer:
      "Our estate teams receive specialized training in caring for fine furnishings, antiques, art, and luxury finishes. We use appropriate products for marble, hardwood, silk, leather, and delicate materials. We document pre-existing conditions and follow your specific instructions for irreplaceable items.",
  },
  {
    question: "What insurance coverage do you carry for estate cleaning?",
    answer:
      "We carry $2 million in general liability coverage specifically because we work in high-value properties. All team members are bonded, background-checked, and trained to work in luxury environments. We're happy to provide certificates of insurance to you or your estate manager.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer same-day or emergency estate cleaning?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Estate clients receive priority scheduling, including same-day service when available. Whether you're hosting an unexpected gathering or need pre-event preparation, we do our best to accommodate urgent requests for our estate clients.",
