## Broken Listing Checklist

### Common NAP Errors to Look For:
- [ ] Wrong phone number (old number, missing area code)
- [ ] Inconsistent business name ("Valley Clean Team" vs "The Valley Clean Team")
- [ ] Wrong city listed (should be Tuscumbia, AL for primary)
- [ ] Full street address exposed (should be hidden for SAB)
- [ ] Wrong category (cleaning vs janitorial vs maid service)
- [ ] Duplicate listings on same platform
- [ ] Missing website URL
- [ ] Old/incorrect hours

### Correction Priority Order:
1. **Data Aggregators** (1-4) - Fixes cascade to other sites
2. **Google Business Profile** (5) - Most important for local SEO
3. **Yelp, Facebook, Bing, Apple** (6-10) - High visibility
4. **Industry Directories** (21-28) - Lead generation
5. **Everything else** (11-40) - Authority building

## Tools for Citation Management

1. **BrightLocal** - Citation audit and building ($29/mo)
2. **Whitespark** - Citation finder and tracker

4. **Yext** - Enterprise citation management (expensive)

## Notes

- For SAB, focus on **service area coverage** not address visibility
- Consistency in business NAME and PHONE is more important than address
- Reviews mentioning specific cities help rank in those areas
- Your website location pages (/locations/huntsville/, etc.) support local SEO
- Consider creating a simple tracking spreadsheet to monitor all 40 listings
