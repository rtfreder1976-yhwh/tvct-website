## SECTION 1: Whisk Animate Prompts (FREE - 5 videos/month)

### How Whisk Works
1. Generate or upload a **still image** first
2. Perfect the image composition
3. Click **"Animate"** to create 8-second video
4. Whisk adds subtle motion, camera movement, and audio

### Tips for Animation-Ready Images
- Include elements that animate well: curtains, light rays, dust particles, water
- Avoid complex action scenes (Whisk adds subtle motion, not dramatic movement)
- Wide/establishing shots animate better than close-ups
- Include natural light sources for beautiful light animation

## Technical Notes for Video Generation

### Generation Tips
1. **Run each prompt 2-3 times** - AI generation varies; pick the best result
2. **Start with 720p** to save credits during testing, then regenerate winners at 1080p
3. **8-second duration** works best for web backgrounds (can loop seamlessly)
4. **Review audio quality** - Veo3 generates audio; mute if using background music instead

### File Naming Convention
```
tvct-sheffield-hero-v1.mp4
tvct-sheffield-kitchen-v1.mp4
tvct-homepage-hero-v1.mp4
tvct-homepage-team-v1.mp4
```

### Recommended Export Settings
- Format: MP4 (H.264)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (16:9) or 1080x1920 (9:16)
- Frame rate: 24fps (matches Veo3 output)
- Compress for web: Use Handbrake or similar to reduce file size

---

## Video Embedding Best Practices

### Hosting Options

#### Option 1: Cloudinary (Recommended)
Your site already uses Cloudinary for images (`dfjneoiaq`). Upload videos to the same account for:
- Automatic format optimization (`f_auto` serves WebM to Chrome, MP4 to Safari)
- Quality optimization (`q_auto` balances quality/size)
- CDN delivery for fast loading
- Easy resizing and cropping

**Cloudinary Video URL Pattern:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dfjneoiaq/video/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/videos/tvct-homepage-hero.mp4
```

#### Option 2: Direct Upload to `/public/videos/`
For small files (<5MB), self-hosting works fine:
```
/public/videos/tvct-sheffield-hero.mp4
/public/videos/tvct-homepage-hero.mp4
```

### HTML5 Video Element - Hero Background

For autoplay background videos, use these essential attributes:

```html
<video
  autoplay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  preload="auto"
  poster="/images/hero-poster.jpg"
  class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
>
  <!-- WebM first (smaller file, better compression) -->
  <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <!-- MP4 fallback (broader compatibility) -->
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

**Attribute Breakdown:**
| Attribute | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `autoplay` | Starts playing automatically |
| `muted` | REQUIRED for autoplay in all modern browsers |
| `loop` | Restarts when finished |
| `playsinline` | Prevents iOS fullscreen takeover |
| `preload="auto"` | Loads video data eagerly (use for hero) |
| `poster` | Shows image while video loads (critical for LCP) |

### Core Web Vitals Considerations

#### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **Always include a `poster` image** - This displays immediately while video loads
- Preload the poster image for best LCP score
- Keep video file size under 5MB for hero sections

#### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- Set explicit width/height or use CSS `aspect-ratio`
- Use `object-cover` to prevent stretching
- Container should have fixed dimensions

#### Performance Tips
1. **Compress videos aggressively** - Hero backgrounds don't need pristine quality
2. **Target 2-4MB file size** for 8-second hero videos
3. **Use WebM format** where supported (30-50% smaller than MP4)
4. **Lazy load below-fold videos** with `loading="lazy"` or Intersection Observer

### Astro Component Pattern

Create a reusable VideoBackground component:

```astro
---
// src/components/VideoBackground.astro
interface Props {
  src: string;
  poster: string;
  className?: string;
}

const { src, poster, className = '' } = Astro.props;
---

<div class={`relative overflow-hidden ${className}`}>
  <video
    autoplay
    muted
    loop
    playsinline
    preload="auto"
    poster={poster}
    class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
  >
    <source src={src.replace('.mp4', '.webm')} type="video/webm" />
    <source src={src} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <div class="relative z-10">
    <slot />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Mobile Considerations

1. **Autoplay works on mobile** IF video is muted
2. **Data usage** - Consider hiding video on mobile or using smaller files
3. **Battery** - Background videos consume power; use sparingly
4. **9:16 videos** for mobile-first hero sections

**Responsive Video Loading:**
```html
<video class="hidden md:block" ...>
  <!-- Desktop video -->
</video>
<img class="md:hidden" src="mobile-poster.jpg" ...>
  <!-- Mobile shows static image -->
</img>
```

### Cloudinary Video Transformations

If using Cloudinary, optimize with URL parameters:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dfjneoiaq/video/upload/
  f_auto,          <!-- Auto format (WebM/MP4) -->
  q_auto,          <!-- Auto quality -->
  w_1280,          <!-- Max width -->
  du_8,            <!-- Duration limit (8 sec) -->
  br_2m            <!-- Bitrate limit (2 Mbps) -->
/videos/tvct-homepage-hero
```
