## How to Choose a Cleaning Company in [Location]: 5 Steps

Selecting the right cleaning service protects both your home and your 
peace of mind. Follow these steps to make a confident decision:

### Step 1: Verify Insurance and Bonding

Before allowing anyone into your home, confirm the company carries 
liability insurance and is bonded. This protects you if accidents 
happen. **Ask directly:** "Can you provide proof of insurance?"

### Step 2: Read Local Reviews (Not Just Star Ratings)

Look for reviews on Google and Facebook from people in [Location] 
specifically. Pay attention to comments about reliability, 
communication, and whether the same cleaners come each visit.

### Step 3: Ask About Their Cleaning Process

Professional companies should be able to explain exactly what's 
included in their service. Vague answers like "we clean everything" 
are a red flag. Request a written checklist.

### Step 4: Get Pricing in Writing

Reputable cleaners provide clear quotes before the job. Be cautious 
of companies that won't give estimates or add surprise charges after. 
Standard house cleaning in [Location] typically ranges from $125-$250 
depending on home size.

### Step 5: Start with a Single Cleaning

Before committing to a recurring plan, book a one-time cleaning to 
test the service. This lets you evaluate their work without a 
long-term commitment.

**Pro Tip:** The Valley Clean Team offers a satisfaction guarantee 
on every cleaning—if you're not happy, they'll make it right.

## SECTION 7: FAQ SECTION (Essential for AEO)

> **Format these exactly as shown. AI systems pull Q&A pairs directly.**

```
## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning Services in [Location]

### How much does house cleaning cost in [Location]?

House cleaning in [Location] typically costs between $125 and $300, 
depending on home size and service type. Standard cleaning for an 
average 3-bedroom home starts around $125-$175, while deep cleaning 
runs $200-$300. Most companies offer discounts for recurring service.

### How often should I have my house professionally cleaned?

Most families benefit from bi-weekly professional cleaning, which 
maintains cleanliness without excessive cost. Homes with pets, 
children, or high traffic may need weekly service, while singles 
or couples often find monthly cleaning sufficient.

### What's the difference between standard cleaning and deep cleaning?

Standard cleaning covers regular maintenance: vacuuming, mopping, 
bathroom sanitizing, dusting, and kitchen cleaning. Deep cleaning 
adds intensive tasks like inside appliances, baseboards, window 
tracks, and detailed scrubbing—typically needed seasonally or 
before special events.

### Are cleaning companies in [Location] insured?

Reputable cleaning companies carry liability insurance and are 
bonded to protect homeowners. Always ask for proof before booking. 
The Valley Clean Team is fully insured with coverage that protects 
your home and belongings.

### Should I be home during a cleaning?

That's your preference. Many clients provide a door code or 
spare key and aren't home during cleanings. Trustworthy companies 
conduct background checks on all staff. If you prefer to be present 
for your first cleaning, that's completely reasonable.
```

**FAQ Rules:**
- Use exact question phrasing people would type/speak
- Keep answers to 2-4 sentences when possible
- Include specific numbers (prices, frequencies) when relevant
- Naturally mention TVCT in 1-2 answers (not all)
