### Timing Reminder Post
```
⏰ Spring cleaning timing reminder for North Alabama & Middle Tennessee:

IDEAL WINDOW: Mid-March to early April

Why?
✓ After the worst pollen peaks
✓ Before summer humidity arrives
✓ Perfect weather for opening windows

If you're hiring help, book NOW. Spring is the busiest season for cleaning companies—2-4 week wait times are normal.

## POLLEN-SPECIFIC POST

```
🟡 Pollen season is rough in Alabama & Tennessee.

Here's how spring cleaning actually helps:

1. HVAC filters - Swap to high-efficiency during peak pollen
2. Ceiling fans - All that dust? A lot of it is pollen
3. Soft surfaces - Vacuum upholstery, wash curtains
4. Window tracks - Pollen accumulates here
5. Bedding - Wash everything, including pillows

Spring cleaning removes what's already in your home. Then maintenance keeps it from building back up.
