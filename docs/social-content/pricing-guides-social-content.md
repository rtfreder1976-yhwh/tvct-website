## EDUCATIONAL POST: RED FLAGS

```
🚩 Cleaning company red flags (pricing edition):

1. "$49 whole house cleaning!" — Do the math. That's not sustainable.

2. Won't give a price until they're in your home — Recipe for surprise charges.

3. Way cheaper than everyone else — Insurance costs money. Training costs money. You get what you pay for.

4. No written quote — Verbal agreements protect nobody.

5. Price changes after the job — Legitimate companies honor their quotes.

A good cleaning costs money. A bad one costs more (in time, frustration, and damage).
