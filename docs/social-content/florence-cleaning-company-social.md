[TVCT logo]

### Slide 2
**Step 1: Verify Insurance**

Before anyone enters your home, ask:
"Can you provide proof of insurance?"

This protects YOU if accidents happen.
No insurance = no booking.

### Slide 3
**Step 2: Read LOCAL Reviews**

Look for reviews from people in Florence specifically.

Pay attention to:
• Reliability
• Communication  
• Same cleaners each visit?

### Slide 4
**Step 3: Ask About Their Process**

"We clean everything" is a red flag.

Real professionals can explain exactly what's included.

Request a written checklist.

### Slide 5
**Step 4: Get Pricing in Writing**

Reputable cleaners give clear quotes BEFORE the job.

Standard cleaning in Florence:
$125 - $250 (depending on home size)

Test the service before committing to recurring.

Good companies will be happy to earn your trust first.
