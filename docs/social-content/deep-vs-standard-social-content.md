### Poll Post

Quick poll: How often does your home get a DEEP clean? 

(Not regular tidying—we mean inside appliances, baseboards, ceiling fans, the works.)

🅰️ Never / only when moving
🅱️ Once a year (maybe)
🅲️ 2-4 times per year
🅳️ I hire someone for this

No judgment! Just curious.

Here's what makes deep cleaning different from standard cleaning:

✅ Standard cleaning MAINTAINS:
- Surfaces stay dusted
- Floors stay clean
- Bathrooms stay fresh

✅ Deep cleaning RESETS:
- Inside your oven and fridge
- Behind your furniture
- Your baseboards and ceiling fans
- Window tracks and vents
- All the spots you "never get to"

Most homes need: standard maintenance + 2-4 deep cleans per year.

### Value Post

"Why is deep cleaning more expensive than regular cleaning?"

Fair question. Here's why:

⏱️ TIME: 4-6 hours vs 2-3 hours
🧹 TASKS: 2-3x more detailed work
💪 LABOR: More intensive physical effort
🧽 SUPPLIES: More product used

Deep cleaning addresses everything that accumulates when you only do surface cleaning.

Think of it like this:
- Standard cleaning = routine maintenance
- Deep cleaning = the tune-up your home needs a few times a year
