## ENGAGEMENT POSTS

### Poll Post
```
Moving soon? Quick poll:

How do you plan to handle move-out cleaning?

🅰️ DIY (spending my last weekend scrubbing)
🅱️ Hire professionals (protect my deposit)
🅲️ Hope for the best 🤞
🅳️ Already lost deposits to this before 😅

No judgment—moving is exhausting. But here's the math: professional cleaning usually costs LESS than what landlords deduct.

#MovingOut #SecurityDeposit #CleaningServices
```

### Educational Post
```
What landlords ACTUALLY check during move-out inspection:

🔍 Inside the oven (grease = instant deduction)
🔍 Inside the refrigerator (every shelf and drawer)
🔍 Behind the toilet (always)
🔍 Bathroom grout (mold = red flag)
🔍 Baseboards throughout
🔍 Window tracks (dirt accumulation)
🔍 Cabinet interiors
🔍 Light fixtures (dust and bugs)

Regular cleaning misses most of these. Move-out cleaning addresses them all.

### Timing Post
```
📅 When to schedule move-out cleaning:

1️⃣ Book 1-2 weeks ahead (2-3 in Nashville)
2️⃣ Move your stuff OUT first
3️⃣ Schedule cleaning for the NEXT day
4️⃣ Walkthrough 1-2 days AFTER cleaning

Why clean an empty home? We can reach everything—inside closets, behind where furniture was, entire floors.

Results are noticeably better.
