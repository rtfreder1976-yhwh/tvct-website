## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **NAP Consistency is CRITICAL** - Your Name, Address, and Phone must be EXACTLY the same on every listing. Even small differences (St. vs Street, LLC vs no LLC) can hurt your SEO.

2. **Complete Profiles Win** - Platforms favor complete profiles. Fill out every field, add maximum photos, write full descriptions.

3. **Verify Everything** - Unverified listings have limited visibility. Complete all verification steps.

4. **Monitor & Maintain** - Set calendar reminders to:
   - Check listings monthly for accuracy
   - Respond to new reviews within 24-48 hours
   - Update hours for holidays
   - Add new photos quarterly

5. **Track Login Credentials** - Use a password manager to store all login information securely.
